Subject: errata in 80386 ref manual

Hello,

I found your 80386 reference manual very useful. Thank you!

I found some errata that I thought you might be interested in
correcting:

1) in
	http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2006/readings/i386/s06_03.htm
section 6.3.1 figure 6-1 I think bit 11 of the Executable Segment
Selector should be set to 1.

2) In table 6-2 I think the "Max seg size" is incorrect for case 2 and 3
(and 4?), and "Min seg size" is incorrect for case 2 and 3.

3) in 
	http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2006/readings/i386/s09_06.htm
section 9.6.1.2 it states that "IRET increments EIP by an extra 4
bytes."  I beleive it increments ESP, not EIP.

Thanks!
