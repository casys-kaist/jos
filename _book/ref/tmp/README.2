Subject: Bug in i386 documentation on the website

Our local copy of the i386 documentation has a bug in Figure 5-6
located at
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/i386/s05_01.htm

It incorrectly shows the RPL field in a segment selector as having
three bits, rather than two. A friend I was helping with this week's
homework was getting confused by this today. I'm not sure if there's a
newer version somewhere we can pull an updated version from...
