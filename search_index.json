to KAIST's CS530 JOS project. You will implement a simple operating system named JOS developed by MIT which has been used in courses at several other schools.\nJOS is simpler than Linux and Windows, but it includes most key operating systems abstractions, including a bootloader, memory protection, memory relocation, multiprogramming, a rudimentary file system, and a command shell.\nJOS can be thought of as an exokernel, where the kernel implements a minimal set of core functionality that safely exports hardware resources to applications. These low-level kernel interfaces may be inconvenient for user processes to use directly, so user processes will make use of a \"library operating system\" (libos) to abstract these low-level exported resources into more convenient programming abstractions.\nEach lab in the series enhances the functionality of your operating system. Each lab builds on the previous one, so it is important that you design, build, and test carefully at each step. Carelessness in early labs will be costly down the road. There are not a lot of lines of code to write on this project; take some time to understand each phase before moving to the next one.\n"},"LAB1.html":{"url":"LAB1.html","title":"Lab 1: Booting a PC","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\n\nThis lab is split into three parts.\nThe first part concentrates on getting familiarized\nwith x86 assembly language,\nthe QEMU x86 emulator,\nand the PC's power-on bootstrap procedure.\nThe second part examines the boot loader for our CS 530 kernel,\nwhich resides in the boot directory of the lab tree.\nFinally, the third part delves into the initial template\nfor our CS 530 kernel itself,\nnamed JOS,\nwhich resides in the kernel directory.\n\n\n\nSoftware Setup\n\nThe files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments in this\ncourse are distributed using the Git\nversion control system.\n\n\n\nGit is a powerful, but tricky, version control system.\nWe highly recommend taking time to understand git so that you will be comfortable using it during the \nlabs.\nWe recommend the following resources to learn more about git:\n\n     A visual git reference\nThis is a MUST READ. the easist one to explain who git works with good visual aid\n Understanding git conceptually\nThis is a highly-recommended READ if you want to work on git smoothly. (You may \nskip the last part: Rebasing, for now)\n Quick 15-20 mins online exercise to get to know git.\n Git\nuser's manual\n If you are already familiar with other version control\nsystems, you may find this\nCS-oriented\noverview of Git useful.\n-->\n\n\n\n\nEach student (enrolled and on the waiting list) \nwill be given access to a department system \nwith the basic required software installed.  \nYou will have root access to this machine, and be able to install additional \ntools (editors, debuggers, etc) as you see fit.\n\n\n\nYou are also welcome to install the needed software on your own laptop.\nThe course staff is not available to help you debug your personal\nlaptop configuration.\nThe tools page\nhas directions on how to set up qemu and gcc for\nuse with JOS.\n\n\nGetting started with git\n\n\nYou will clone the read-only git repository on the course webpage, using the command below to get the baseline code:\n\n\nkermit% git clone https://github.com/casys-kaist/jos.git\nkermit% cd jos\nkermit% git checkout lab1\n\n\nNote, having this read-only git repository also allows the instructor to post bugfixes, should they be required.\n\n\nGit allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.\nFor example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want\nto checkpoint your progress, you can commit your changes\nby running:\n\n\nkermit% git commit -am 'my solution for lab1 exercise9'\nCreated commit 60d2135: my solution for lab1 exercise9\n 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n\n\n\nYou can keep track of your changes by using the git diff command.\nRunning git diff will display the changes to your code since your\nlast commit, and git diff origin/lab1 will display the changes\nrelative to the initial code supplied for this lab.\nHere, origin/lab1 is the name of the git branch with the\ninitial code you downloaded from our server for this assignment.\n\n\nWe have set up the appropriate compilers and simulators for you on\nthe CS lab machines.\n\n\n\nPart 1: PC Bootstrap\n\n\nThe purpose of the first exercise\nis to introduce you to x86 assembly language\nand the PC bootstrap process,\nand to get you started with QEMU and QEMU/GDB debugging.\nYou will not have to write any code for this part of the lab,\nbut you should go through it anyway for your own understanding\nand be prepared to answer the questions posed below.\n\n\nGetting Started with x86 assembly\n\n\nIf you are not already familiar with x86 assembly language,\nyou will quickly become familiar with it during this course!\nThe PC Assembly Language Book\nis an excellent place to start.\nHopefully, the book contains mixture of new and old material for you.\n\n\nWarning: Unfortunately the examples in the book are\nwritten for the NASM assembler, whereas we will be using\nthe GNU assembler. NASM uses the so-called Intel syntax\nwhile GNU uses the AT&T syntax. While semantically\nequivalent, an assembly file will differ quite a lot, at least\nsuperficially, depending on which syntax is used. Luckily the\nconversion between the two is pretty simple, and is covered in\n\nBrennan's Guide to Inline Assembly.\n\n\n\nExercise 1.\n  Read or at least carefully scan the entire\nPC Assembly Language book,\nexcept that you should skip all sections after 1.3.5 in chapter 1,\nwhich talk about features of the NASM assembler\nthat do not apply directly to the GNU assembler.\nYou may also skip chapters 5 and 6, and all sections under 7.2,\nwhich deal with processor and language features we won't use.\nThis reading is useful when trying to understand\nassembly in JOS, and writing your own assembly. If you have never seen\nassembly before, read this book carefully.\n\n\nAlso read the section \"The Syntax\" in\nBrennan's Guide to Inline Assembly\n\nto familiarize yourself with the most important features\nof GNU assembler syntax.  JOS uses the GNU assembler.\n\nWe will be developing JOS for the 64-bit version of the x86 architecture (also known as amd64).\nThe assembly is very similar to 32-bit, with a few key differences.\nRead this guide, which explains the key differences\nbetween the assembly.\nBecome familiar with inline assembly by writing a simple program.\nModify the program ex1.c to include inline assembly that increments the\nvalue of x by 1.

In one, enter make\nqemu-gdb (or make qemu-nox-gdb).  This starts up QEMU, but QEMU stops just before the\nprocessor executes the first instruction and waits for a debugging\nconnection from GDB.  In the second terminal, from the same directory\nyou ran make, run gdb.  You should see something\nlike this,\n\nkermit% gdb\nGNU gdb (GDB) 6.8-debian\nCopyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later \nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

()\n(gdb) \n\n\nWe provided a .gdbinit file that set up GDB to debug the\n16-bit code used during early boot and directed it to attach to the\nlistening QEMU.\n\nThe following line:\n\n[f000:fff0] 0xffff0:    ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b\n\n\nis GDB's disassembly of the first instruction to be executed.\nFrom this output you can conclude a few things: \n\n\n\n    The IBM PC starts executing at physical address 0x000ffff0,\n    which is at the very top of the 64KB area reserved for the ROM BIOS.\n\n    The PC starts executing\n    with CS = 0xf000 and IP = 0xfff0.\n\n    The first instruction to be executed is a jmp instruction,\n    which jumps to the segmented address\n    CS = 0xf000 and IP = 0xe05b.\n\n\n\nWhy does QEMU start like this?\nThis is how Intel designed the 8088 processor,\nwhich IBM used in their original PC.\nBecause the BIOS in a PC is \"hard-wired\"\nto the physical address range 0x000f0000-0x000fffff,\nthis design ensures that the BIOS always gets control of the machine first\nafter power-up or any system restart -\nwhich is crucial because on power-up\nthere is no other software anywhere in the machine's RAM\nthat the processor could execute.\nThe QEMU emulator comes with its own BIOS,\nwhich it places at this location\nin the processor's simulated physical address space.\nOn processor reset,\nthe (simulated) processor enters real mode\nand sets CS to 0xf000 and the IP to 0xfff0, so that\nexecution begins at that (CS:IP) segment address.\nHow does the segmented address 0xf000:fff0\nturn into a physical address?\n\n\n\nTo answer that we need to know a bit about real mode addressing.\nIn real mode (the mode that PC starts off in),\naddress translation works according to the formula:\nphysical address = 16 * segment + offset.\nSo, when the PC sets CS to 0xf000 and IP to\n0xfff0, the physical address referenced is:\n\n   16 * 0xf000 + 0xfff0   # in hex multiplication by 16 is\n   = 0xf0000 + 0xfff0     # easy--just append a 0.\n   = 0xffff0 \n\n\n\n0xffff0 is 16 bytes before the end of the BIOS (0x100000).\nTherefore we shouldn't be surprised that the\nfirst thing that the BIOS does is jmp backwards\nto an earlier location in the BIOS; after all\nhow much could it accomplish in just 16 bytes?\n\n\n\n    (Self-study) Exercise 2.\n    Use GDB's si (Step Instruction) command\n    to trace into the ROM BIOS\n    for a few more instructions,\n    and try to guess what it might be doing.\n    You might want to look at\n    Phil Storrs I/O Ports Description,\n    as well as other materials on the\n    reference materials page.\n    No need to figure out all the details -\n    just the general idea of what the BIOS is doing first.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the BIOS runs,\nit sets up an interrupt descriptor table\nand initializes various devices such as the VGA display.\nThis is where the \"Starting SeaBIOS\" messages\nyou see in the QEMU window come from.\n\n\n\nAfter initializing the PCI bus\nand all the important devices the BIOS knows about,\nit searches for a bootable device\nsuch as a floppy, hard drive, or CD-ROM.\nEventually, when it finds a bootable disk,\nthe BIOS reads the boot loader from the disk\nand transfers control to it.\n\n\nPart 2: The Boot Loader\n\nFloppy and hard disks for PCs are\ndivided into 512 byte regions called sectors.\nA sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity:\neach read or write operation must be one or more sectors in size\nand aligned on a sector boundary.\nIf the disk is bootable,\nthe first sector is called the boot sector,\nsince this is where the boot loader code resides.\nWhen the BIOS finds a bootable floppy or hard disk,\nit loads the 512-byte boot sector\ninto memory at physical addresses 0x7c00 through 0x7dff,\nand then uses a jmp instruction\nto set the CS:IP to 0000:7c00,\npassing control to the boot loader.\nLike the BIOS load address,\nthese addresses are fairly arbitrary -\nbut they are fixed and standardized for PCs.\n\n\n\nThe ability to boot from a CD-ROM came much later\nduring the evolution of the PC,\nand as a result the PC architects took the opportunity\nto rethink the boot process slightly.\nAs a result,\nthe way a modern BIOS boots from a CD-ROM\nis a bit more complicated (and more powerful).\nCD-ROMs use a sector size of 2048 bytes instead of 512,\nand the BIOS can load a much larger boot image from the disk into memory\n(not just one sector)\nbefore transferring control to it.\nFor more information,\nsee the \"El Torito\" Bootable CD-ROM Format Specification.\n\n\n\n\nFor this class, however,\nwe will use the conventional hard drive boot mechanism,\nwhich means that the BIOS will only load the first \n512 bytes.  \nThe bootloader (boot/boot.S and boot/main.c)\ndoes the bootstrapping work.  \nLook through these source files carefully\nand make sure you understand what's going on.\nThe boot loader must perform the following main functions:\n\n\n\n First, the boot loader obtains a map of the physical memory present\n     in the system from the BIOS.  This is done using a system call to the BIOS (int 0x15),\n     which returns a structure called an e820 map. For more details about e820 map, \n         check out this \n         link.\n     This call is possible only while the processor is \n     still in real mode.  JOS's bootloader constructs a multiboot\n     structure, which it passes to the kernel.  Multiboot is a standard for passing boot information \n     from the bootloader to a kernel.\n\n\n    The boot loader then switches the processor from real mode to\n    32-bit protected mode,\n    because it is only in this mode\n    that software can access all the memory above 1MB\n    in the processor's physical address space.\n    Protected mode is described briefly\n    in sections 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 of\n    PC Assembly Language,\n    and in great detail in the Intel architecture manuals.\n    At this point you only have to understand\n    that translation of segmented addresses (segment:offset pairs)\n    into physical addresses happens differently in protected mode,\n    and that after the transition\n    offsets are 32 bits instead of 16.\n    \n\n    One of the arcane x86 features the bootloader handles is properly configuring address bit 20.  To better understand this, skim this article.\n\n\n\n    The bootloader then tests whether the CPU supports long (64-bit) mode.\n    It initializes a simple set of page tables for the first 4GB of memory.\n    These pages map virtual addresses in the lowest 3GB to the same physical addresses,\n    and then map the upper 256 MB back to the lowest 256 MB of memory.\n    At this point, the bootloader places the CPU in long mode.\n    Note that our bootloader transitioning to long mode isn't strictly necessary;\n    typically, a bootloader only runs in long mode to load\n    a 64-bit kernel at a high (>4 GB) virtual memory address.\n    \n    Note that once we transfer control to the kernel, the kernel\n    assumes the CPU supports 64-bit mode.  Assuming the kernel was loaded \n    in the lower 4GB of virtual address space, \n    the kernel itself could test whether the CPU supports long mode\n    and determine dynamically whether to run in 64 or 32-bit mode.\n    Of course, this would substantially complicate the boot process.\n\n-->\n    The bootloader sets up the stack and starts executing the kernel's C code in boot/main.c.\n\n    Finally, the boot loader reads the kernel from the hard disk\n    by directly accessing the IDE disk device registers\n    via the x86's special I/O instructions.\n    If you would like to understand better\n    what the particular I/O instructions here mean,\n    check out the \"IDE hard drive controller\" section\n    on the reference page.\n    You will not need to learn much\n    about programming specific devices in this class:\n    writing device drivers is in practice\n    a very important part of OS development,\n    but from a conceptual or architectural viewpoint\n    it is also one of the least interesting.\n\n\n\nAfter you understand the boot loader source code,\nlook at the files obj/boot/boot.asm.\nThis file is a disassembly of the boot loader\nthat our GNUmakefile creates after compiling the boot loader.\nThis disassembly file makes it easy to see\nexactly where in physical memory all of the boot loader's code resides,\nand makes it easier to track what's happening\nwhile stepping through the boot loader in GDB.\n\n\n\nYou can set address breakpoints in GDB with the b command.  You\nhave to start hex numbers with 0x, so say something like hb *0x7c00 sets a\nbreakpoint at address 0x7C00. Note: an artifact of our infrastructure causes b not to work properly; use hb instead.\nOnce at a breakpoint, you can continue\nexecution using the c and\nsi commands: c causes\nQEMU to continue execution until the next breakpoint (or until you press\n\nCtrl-C in GDB), and si\nN steps through the instructions N at a time.\n\n\n\nTo examine instructions in memory (besides the immediate next one to be\nexecuted, which GDB prints automatically), you use the\nx/i command.  This command has the syntax\n\nx/Ni ADDR, where N is the\nnumber of consecutive instructions to disassemble and ADDR is the\nmemory address at which to start disassembling.\n\n\n\nExercise 3.\n       Take a look at the lab tools guide,\n       especially the section on GDB commands. Even if you're familiar\n       with GDB, this includes some esoteric GDB commands that are\n       useful for OS work.\n\n       \n    Set a breakpoint at address 0x7c00, which is\n    where the boot sector will be loaded.\n    Continue execution until that break point.\n    Trace through the code in boot/boot.S,\n    using the source code and the disassembly file\n    obj/boot/boot.asm to keep track of where you are.\n    Also use the x/i command in GDB to disassemble\n    sequences of instructions in the boot loader,\n    and compare the original boot loader source code\n    with both the disassembly in obj/boot/boot.asm\n\n    and GDB.\n\n    \n    Trace into bootmain() in boot/main.c,\n    and then into readsect().\n    Identify the exact assembly instructions\n    that correspond to each of the statements in readsect().\n    Trace through the rest of readsect()\n\n    and back out into bootmain(),\n    and identify the begin and end of the for loop\n    that reads the remaining sectors of the kernel from the disk.\n    Find out what code will run when the loop is finished,\n    set a breakpoint there, and continue to that breakpoint.\n    Then step through the remainder of the boot loader.\n\n\n\nBe able to answer the following questions:\n\n\n    At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code?\n    What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?\n    What is the last instruction of the boot loader executed,\n    and what is the first instruction of the kernel it just loaded?\n\n    How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read\n    in order to fetch the entire kernel from disk?\n    Where does it find this information?\n\n\n\n Loading the Kernel \n\n\nWe will now look in further detail\nat the C language portion of the boot loader,\nin boot/main.c.\nBut before doing so,\nthis is a good time to stop and review\nsome of the basics of C programming.\n\n\n\n(Self-study) Exercise 4.\n\n    Read about programming with pointers in C.  The best reference\n    for the C language is The C Programming Language\n    by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (known as 'K&R').  \n    We recommend that students\n    purchase this book (here is an\n    \n    Amazon Link).\n    There are several copies on reserve in the Science and Engineering library as well.\n    \n    \n    Read 5.1 (Pointers and Addresses) through 5.5 (Character Pointers\n    and Functions) in K&R.  Then download the code for\n    pointers.c, run it, and make sure you\n    understand where all of the printed values come from.  In particular,\n    make sure you understand where the pointer addresses in lines 1 and\n    6 come from, how all the values in lines 2 through 4 get there, and\n    why the values printed in line 5 are seemingly corrupted.\n    -->\n\n     There are other references on pointers in C, though not\n    as strongly recommended.\n    A tutorial by Ted Jensen \n    that cites K&R heavily is available in the course readings.\n    \n\n    We also recommend reading the Ksplice\n    pointer challenge as a way to test that you understand how\n    pointer arithmetic and arrays work in C.  \n\n    \n    Warning:\n    Unless you are already thoroughly versed in C,\n    do not skip or even skim this reading exercise.\n    If you do not really understand pointers in C,\n    you will suffer untold pain and misery in subsequent labs,\n    and then eventually come to understand them the hard way.\n    Trust us; you don't want to find out what \"the hard way\" is.\n    \n\n\n\nTo make sense out of boot/main.c\nyou'll need to know what an ELF binary is.\nWhen you compile and link a C program such as the JOS kernel,\nthe compiler transforms each C source ('.c') file\ninto an object ('.o') file\ncontaining assembly language instructions\nencoded in the binary format expected by the hardware.\nThe linker then combines all of the compiled object files\ninto a single binary image such as obj/kern/kernel,\nwhich in this case is a binary in the ELF format,\nwhich stands for \"Executable and Linkable Format\".\n\n\n\n\nFull information about this format is available in\nthe ELF specification\non our reference page,\nbut you will not need to delve very deeply\ninto the details of this format in this class.\nAlthough as a whole the format is quite powerful and complex,\nmost of the complex parts are for supporting\ndynamic loading of shared libraries,\nwhich we will not do in this class.\n\n\n\nFor purposes of this class,\nyou can consider an ELF executable to be\na header with loading information,\nfollowed by several program sections,\neach of which is a contiguous chunk of code or data\nintended to be loaded into memory at a specified address.\nThe boot loader does not modify the code or data; it\nloads it into memory and starts executing it.\n\n\n\nAn ELF binary starts with a fixed-length ELF header,\nfollowed by a variable-length program header\nlisting each of the program sections to be loaded.\nThe C definitions for these ELF headers are in inc/elf.h.\nThe program sections we're interested in are:\n\n\n    .text:\n    The program's executable instructions.\n    .rodata:\n    Read-only data,\n    such as ASCII string constants produced by the C compiler.\n    (We will not bother setting up the hardware to prohibit writing,\n    however.)\n\n    .data:\n    The data section holds the program's initialized data,\n    such as global variables declared with initializers\n    like int x = 5;.\n\n\n\nWhen the linker computes the memory layout of a program,\nit reserves space for uninitialized global variables,\nsuch as int x;,\nin a section called .bss\n\nthat immediately follows .data in memory.\nC requires that \"uninitialized\" global variables start with\na value of zero.\nThus there is no need to store contents for .bss\nin the ELF binary; instead, the linker records just the address and\nsize of the .bss section.\nThe loader or the program itself must arrange to zero the\n.bss section.\n\n\n\nYou can display a full list of the names, sizes, and link addresses\nof all the sections in the kernel executable by typing:\n\n\n\n\nkermit% objdump -h obj/kern/kernel\n\n\n\nYou will see many more sections than the ones we listed above,\nbut the others are not important for our purposes.\nMost of the others are to hold debugging information,\nwhich is typically included in the program's executable file\nbut not loaded into memory by the program loader.\n\n\n\nTake particular note of the \"VMA\" (or link address) and the\n\"LMA\" (or load address) of the\n.text section.\nThe load address of a section is the memory address at which that\nsection should be loaded into memory.  In the ELF object, this is\nstored in the ph->p_pa field (in this case, it really\nis a physical address, though the ELF specification is vague on the\nactual meaning of this field).\n\n\n\nThe link address of a section is the memory address from which the\nsection expects to execute.  The linker encodes the link address in\nthe binary in various ways, such as when the code needs the address of\na global variable, with the result that a binary usually won't work if\nit is executing from an address that it is not linked for.  (It is\npossible to generate position-independent code that does not\ncontain any such absolute addresses.  This is used extensively by\nmodern shared libraries, but it has performance and complexity costs,\nso we won't be using it in this class.)\n\n\n\nTypically, the link and load addresses are the same.  For example,\nlook at the .text section of the boot loader:\n\n\nkermit objdump -h obj/boot/boot.out\n\n\nThe BIOS loads the boot sector into memory starting at address 0x7c00,\nso this is the boot sector's load address.  This is also where the\nboot sector executes from, so this is also its link address.  We set\nthe link address by passing -Ttext 0x7C00 to the linker in\nboot/Makefrag, so the linker will produce the correct memory\naddresses in the generated code.\n\n\n\n(Self-study) Exercise 5.\n    Trace through the first few instructions of the boot loader again\n    and identify the first instruction that would \"break\"\n    or otherwise do the wrong thing\n    if you were to get the boot loader's link address wrong.\n    Then change the link address in boot/Makefrag\n    to something wrong,\n    run make clean,\n    recompile the lab with make,\n    and trace into the boot loader again to see what happens.\n    Don't forget to change the link address back and make\n    clean again afterward!\n\n\n\nLook back at the load and link addresses for the kernel.  Unlike the\nboot loader, these two addresses aren't the same: the kernel is\ntelling the boot loader to load it into memory at a low address (1\nmegabyte), but it expects to execute from a high address.  We'll dig\nin to how we make this work in the next section.\n\n\n\nBesides the section information,\nthere is one more field in the ELF header that is important to us,\nnamed e_entry.\nThis field holds the link address\nof the entry point in the program:\nthe memory address in the program's text section\nat which the program should begin executing.\nYou can see the entry point:\n\n\n\n\nkermit% objdump -f obj/kern/kernel\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to understand the minimal ELF loader in\nboot/main.c.  It reads each section of the kernel from disk\ninto memory at the section's load address and then jumps to the\nkernel's entry point.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.\n    We can examine memory using GDB's x command.  The\n    GDB\n    manual has full details, but for now, it is enough to know\n    that the command x/Nx ADDR prints\n    N words of memory at ADDR.\n    (Note that both 'x's in the command are lowercase.)\n    Warning: The size of a word is not a universal standard.\n    In GNU assembly, a word is two bytes (the 'w' in xorw, which\n    stands for word, means 2 bytes).\n    \n\n    \n    Reset the machine (exit QEMU/GDB and start them again).\n    Examine the 8 words of memory at 0x00100000 \n    at the point the BIOS enters the boot loader,\n    and then again at the point the boot loader enters the kernel.\n    Why are they different?\n    What is there at the second breakpoint?\n    (You do not really need to use QEMU to answer this question.\n    Just think.)\n\n\n\n\nLink vs. Load Address\n\n\nThe load address of a binary\nis the memory address at which a binary is actually loaded.\nFor example, the BIOS is loaded by the PC hardware at\naddress 0xf0000. So this is the BIOS's load address.\nSimilarly, the BIOS loads the boot sector at address 0x7c00. So\nthis is the boot sector's load address.\n\n\n\n\nThe link address of a binary\nis the memory address for which the binary is linked.\nLinking a binary for a given link address\nprepares it to be loaded at that address. \nThe linker encodes the link address in the binary in various\nways, for example when the code needs the address of a global\nvariable,\nwith the result that a binary usually won't work if it is not loaded\nat the address that it is linked for.\n\n\nIn one sentence:\nthe link address is the location where a binary\nassumes it is going to be loaded,\nwhile the load address is the location\nwhere a binary is loaded.\nIt's up to us to make sure that they turn out to be the same.\n\n\n\nLook at the -Ttext linker command\nin boot/Makefrag,\nand at the address mentioned\nearly in the linker script in kern/kernel.ld.\nThese set the link address for the boot loader and kernel respectively.\n\n\n\n\nWhen object code contains no absolute addresses that\nencode the link address in this fashion,\nwe say that the code is position-independent:\nit will behave correctly no matter where it is loaded.\nGCC can generate position-independent code using the -fpic option,\nand this feature is used extensively in modern shared libraries\nthat use the ELF executable format.\nPosition independence typically has some performance cost, however,\nbecause it restricts the ways in which the compiler may choose instructions\nto access the program's data.\nWe will not use -fpic in this class.\n\n-->\nPart 3: The Kernel\n\n\nWe will now start to examine the minimal JOS kernel in a bit more detail.\n(And you will finally get to write some code!).\nLike the boot loader,\nthe kernel begins with some assembly language code\nthat sets things up so that C language code can execute properly.\n\n\n\nThe initial assembly code of the kernel does the following:\n\n\n    When the kernel starts executing, the processor is in the 32-bit protected mode. The first thing the kernel does is it tests whether the CPU supports long (64-bit) mode.\n     The kernel initializes a simple set of page tables for the first 4GB of memory. These pages map virtual addresses in the lowest 3GB to the same physical addresses, and then map the upper 256 MB back to the lowest 256 MB of memory. At this point, the kernel places the CPU in long mode. The kernel could determine dynamically whether to run in 64 or 32-bit mode based on whether the CPU supports long mode. Of course, this would substantially complicate the kernel.\n    \n     Finally, the kernel sets up the stack and a few other things to start executing C code.\n\nLook through the kernel source files kern/entry.S and kern/bootstrap.S\nand be able to answer the following question\n\n    At what point does the processor start executing 64-bit code?\n    What exactly causes the switch from 32- to 64-bit mode?\n\n\nUsing segmentation to work around position dependence\n\n\nDid you notice above\nthat while the boot loader's link and load addresses match perfectly,\nthere appears to be a (rather large) disparity\nbetween the kernel's link and load addresses?\nGo back and check both and make sure you can see what we're talking about.\n\n\n\nOperating system kernels often like to be linked and run\nat very high virtual address, such as 0x8004100000,\nin order to leave the lower part of the processor's virtual address space\nfor user programs to use.\nThe reason for this arrangement will become clearer in the next lab.\n\n\n\n\nMany machines don't have any physical memory at address 0x8004100000\nso we can't count on being able to store the kernel there.\nInstead, we will use the processor's memory management hardware\nto map virtual address0x8004100000 -\nthe link address at which the kernel code expects to run -\nto physical address 0x100000---\nwhere the boot loader loaded the kernel.\nThis way, although the kernel's virtual address is high enough\nto leave plenty of address space for user processes,\nit will be loaded in physical memory at the 1MB point in the PC's RAM,\njust above the BIOS ROM.\nThis approach requires that the PC have at least a few megabytes of\nphysical memory (so that address 0x00100000 works), but this is likely\nto be true of any PC built after about 1990.\n\n\nWe will eventually map physical address 0x0 \nto virtual address . \n\n\nWe will eventually map the entire bottom 256MB\nof the PC's physical address space,\nfrom 0x00000000 through 0x0fffffff,\nto virtual addresses  0x8004000000 through 0x8013FFFFFF, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x86 processor has two distinct memory management mechanisms\nthat JOS could use to achieve this mapping:\nsegmentation and paging.\nBoth are described in full detail in the\n80386 Programmer's Reference Manual\nand the\nIA-32 Developer's Manual, Volume 3.\nWhen the JOS kernel first starts up,\nit initially uses segmentation\nto establish the desired virtual-to-physical mapping,\nbecause it is quick and easy -\nand the x86 processor requires us\nto set up the segmentation hardware in any case,\nbecause it can't be disabled!\n\n\n\nFor now, we'll just map the first 4MB of physical memory, which will\nbe enough to get us up and running.  We do this using the\nhand-written, statically-initialized page directory and page table in\nkern/entrypgdir.c.  For now, you don't have to understand the\ndetails of how this works, just the effect that it accomplishes.  Up\nuntil kern/entry.S sets the CR0_PG flag, memory\nreferences are treated as physical addresses (strictly speaking,\nthey're linear addresses, but boot/boot.S set up an identity mapping\nfrom linear addresses to physical addresses and we're never going to\nchange that).  Once CR0_PG is set, memory references are\nvirtual addresses that get translated by the virtual memory hardware\nto physical addresses.  entry_pgdir translates virtual\naddresses in the range 0xf0000000 through 0xf0400000 to physical\naddresses 0x00000000 through 0x00400000, as well as virtual addresses\n0x00000000 through 0x00400000 to physical addresses 0x00000000 through\n0x00400000.  Any virtual address that is not in one of these two\nranges will cause a hardware exception which, since we haven't set up\ninterrupt handling yet, will cause QEMU to dump the machine state and\nexit (or endlessly reboot if you aren't using the 506-patched\nversion of QEMU).\n\n--!>\n\n\nFor now, the kernel will initially set up \na hand-written, statically-initialized page tables\nin kern/bootstrap.S.\nFor now, you don't have to understand the\ndetails of how this works, just the effect that it accomplishes.  Up\nuntil kern/bootstrap.S sets the CR0_PG flag, memory\nreferences are treated as physical addresses (strictly speaking,\nthey're linear addresses, but boot/boot.S set up an identity mapping\nfrom linear addresses to physical addresses and we're never going to\nchange that).  Once CR0_PG is set, memory references are\nvirtual addresses that get translated by the virtual memory hardware\nto physical addresses.  pml4 translates virtual\naddresses in the range 0x8004000000  through  0x8013ffffff to physical\naddresses 0x00000000 through 0x0fffffff, as well as virtual addresses\n0x00000000 through 0xefffffff to physical addresses 0x00000000 through\n0xefffffff.  \n\n\n\n\nExercise 7.\n    Use QEMU and GDB to trace into the early JOS kernel boot code (in the kern/boostrap.S directory)\n    and find where the new virtual-to-physical mapping takes effect.\n    Then examine the Global Descriptor Table (GDT)\n    that the code uses to achieve this effect,\n    and make sure you understand what's going on.\n    \n\n    \n    What is the first instruction after the new\n    mapping is established that would fail to work properly\n    if the old mapping were still in place?\n    Comment out or otherwise intentionally break\n    the segmentation setup code in kern/entry.S,\n    trace into it,\n    and see if you were right.\n\n\n\nFormatted Printing to the Console\n\n\nMost people take functions like printf() for granted,\nsometimes even thinking of them as \"primitives\" of the C language.\nBut in an OS kernel, we have to implement all I/O ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Exercise 8.\n    Read chapter five of the Lions book, \"Two Files\".\n    Although it is about UNIX on the PDP11,\n    you may nevertheless find it highly relevant and useful\n    in understanding this section of the lab.\n\n\n-->\n\nRead through kern/printf.c, lib/printfmt.c,\nand kern/console.c,\nand make sure you understand their relationship.\nIt will become clear in later labs why printfmt.c\nis located in the separate lib directory.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8.\n    We have omitted a small fragment of code -\n    the code necessary to print octal numbers\n    using patterns of the form \"%o\".\n    Find and fill in this code fragment.\n\n\n\nBe able to answer the following questions:\n\n\n\n Explain the interface between printf.c and\n\nconsole.c.  Specifically, what function does\nconsole.c export?  How is this function used by\nprintf.c?\n\n Explain the following from console.c:\n\nif (crt_pos >= CRT_SIZE) {\n    int i;\n    memmove(crt_buf, crt_buf + CRT_COLS, (CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS) * sizeof(uint16_t));\n    for (i = CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS; i \n\n Trace the execution of the following code step-by-step:\n\nint x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;\ncprintf(\"x %d, y %x, z %d\\n\", x, y, z);\n\n\n\n    In the call to cprintf(),\n    to what does fmt point?\n    To what does ap point?\n\n List (in order of execution) each call to\ncons_putc, va_arg, and vcprintf.\nFor cons_putc, list its argument as well.  For\nva_arg, list what ap points to before and\nafter the call.  For vcprintf list the values of its\ntwo arguments.\n\n\n Run the following code.\n\n    unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;\n    cprintf(\"H%x Wo%s\", 57616, &i);\n\n\nWhat is the output?  Explain how this output is arrived at in the\nstep-by-step manner of the previous exercise.\n\nHere's an ASCII\n  table that maps bytes to characters.-->\n\nThe output depends on that fact that the x86 is little-endian.  If\nthe x86 were instead big-endian what would you set i to in\norder to yield the same output?  Would you need to change\n\n57616 to a different value?\n\n\nHere's\na description of little- and big-endian\nand\na more\nwhimsical description.\n\n\n\n\nIn the following code, what is going to be printed after\n'y='?  (note: the answer is not a specific value.)  Why\ndoes this happen?\n\n\n\n    cprintf(\"x=%d y=%d\", 3);\n\n\n\n\nLet's say that GCC changed its calling convention so that it\npushed arguments on the stack in declaration order,\nso that the last argument is pushed last.\nHow would you have to change cprintf or its\ninterface so that it would still be possible to pass it a variable\nnumber of arguments?\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 1 (5 bonus points)\n\n    Enhance the console to allow text to be printed in different colors.\n    The traditional way to do this is to make it interpret\n\n    \n    ANSI escape sequences\n    embedded in the text strings printed to the console,\n    but you may use any mechanism you like.\n    There is plenty of information on\n    the reference page\n    and elsewhere on the web on programming the VGA display hardware.\n    If you're feeling really adventurous,\n    you could try switching the VGA hardware into a graphics mode\n    and making the console draw text onto the graphical frame buffer.\n-->\nThe Stack\n\n\nIn the final exercise of this lab,\nwe will explore in more detail\nthe way the C language uses the stack on the x86,\nand in the process write a useful new kernel monitor function\nthat prints a backtrace of the stack:\na list of the saved Instruction Pointer (IP) values\nfrom the nested call instructions that\nled to the current point of execution.\n\n\n\nExercise 9.\n    Determine where the kernel initializes its stack,\n    and exactly where in memory its stack is located.\n    How does the kernel reserve space for its stack?\n    And at which \"end\" of this reserved area\n    is the stack pointer initialized to point to?\n\n\n\n\nThe x86-64 stack pointer (rsp register)\npoints to the lowest location on the stack that is\ncurrently in use.\nEverything below that location in the region reserved for the stack\nis free.\nPushing a value onto the stack involves decreasing the stack\npointer and then writing the value to the place the stack pointer\npoints to.\nPopping a value from the stack involves reading the value\nthe stack pointer points to and then increasing the stack pointer.\nIn 64-bit mode, the stack can only hold 64-bit values,\nand rsp is always divisible by eight.\nVarious x86-64 instructions, such as call,\nare \"hard-wired\" to use the stack pointer register.\n\n\n\nThe rbp (base pointer) register, in contrast,\nis associated with the stack primarily by software convention.\nOn entry to a C function,\nthe function's prologue code normally\nsaves the previous function's base pointer by pushing it onto the stack,\nand then copies the current rsp value into rbp\n\nfor the duration of the function.\nIf all the functions in a program obey this convention,\nthen at any given point during the program's execution,\nit is possible to trace back through the stack\nby following the chain of saved rbp pointers\nand determining exactly what nested sequence of function calls\ncaused this particular point in the program to be reached.\nThis capability can be particularly useful, for example,\nwhen a particular function causes an assert failure or panic\nbecause bad arguments were passed to it,\nbut you aren't sure who passed the bad arguments.\nA stack backtrace lets you find the offending function.\n\n\n\nExercise 10.\n\n    To become familiar with the C calling conventions on the x86-64,\n    find the address of the test_backtrace function\n    in obj/kern/kernel.asm,\n    set a breakpoint there,\n    and examine what happens each time it gets called\n    after the kernel starts.\n    How many 64-bit words does each recursive nesting level\n    of test_backtrace push on the stack,\n    and what are those words?\n\n    Note that, for this exercise to work properly, you should\n    be using the patched version of QEMU available on the tools page or on your course virtual machine.\n    Otherwise, you'll have to manually translate all breakpoint\n    and memory addresses to linear addresses.\n\n\n\n\nThe above exercise should give you the information you need\nto implement a stack backtrace function,\nwhich you should call mon_backtrace().\nA prototype for this function is already waiting for you\nin kern/monitor.c.\nYou can do it entirely in C,\nbut you may find the read_rbp() function in inc/x86.h useful.\nYou'll also have to hook this new function\ninto the kernel monitor's command list\nso that it can be invoked interactively by the user.\n\n\n\n\nThe backtrace function should display a listing of function call frames\nin the following format:\n\n\n\nStack backtrace:\n  rbp 00000000f0111f20  rip 00000000f01000be  \n  rbp 00000000f0111f40  rip 00000000f01000a1  \n  ...\n\n-->\n\nStack backtrace:\n   rbp 000000800421bf20 rip 0000008004201123\n   rbp 000000800421bf40 rip 00000080042000ba\n   rbp 000000800421bf60 rip 000000800420009d\n   rbp 000000800421bf80 rip 000000800420009d\n   rbp 000000800421bfa0 rip 000000800420009d\n   rbp 000000800421bfc0 rip 000000800420009d\n   rbp 000000800421bfe0 rip 000000800420009d\n   rbp 000000800421bff0 rip 0000008004200189\n\n\n\nThe first line printed reflects the currently executing function,\nnamely mon_backtrace itself,\nthe second line reflects the function that called mon_backtrace,\nthe third line reflects the function that called that one, and so on.\nYou should print all the outstanding stack frames.\nBy studying kern/entry.S\n\nyou'll find that there is an easy way to tell when to stop.\n\n\n\nWithin each line,\nthe rbp value indicates the base pointer into the stack\nused by that function:\ni.e., the position of the stack pointer just after the function was entered\nand the function prologue code set up the base pointer.\nThe listed rip value\nis the function's return instruction pointer:\nthe instruction address to which\ncontrol will return when the function returns.\nThe return instruction pointer typically points to the instruction\nafter the call instruction (why?).\n\n\nRead this article on how arguments are mapped to registers on the x86-64 architecture.\nThis is called a calling convention, as software developers agree on this mapping by convention.\nAs the article explains, different compilers may have different standards.  For instance, the Windows x86-64 calling convention differs from the Linux x86-64 calling convention.\n\n\n\nHere are a few specific points you read about in K&R Chapter 5 that are\nworth remembering for the following exercise and for future labs.\n\n\nIf int *p = (int*)100, then \n    (int)p + 1 and (int)(p + 1)\n    are different numbers: the first is 101 but\n    the second is 104.\n    When adding an integer to a pointer, as in the second case,\n    the integer is implicitly multiplied by the size of the object\n    the pointer points to.\n\np[i] is defined to be the same as *(p+i),\nreferring to the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.\nThe above rule for addition helps this definition work\nwhen the objects are larger than one byte.\n &p[i] is the same as (p+i), yielding\nthe address of the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.\n\n\nAlthough most C programs never need to cast between pointers and integers,\noperating systems frequently do.\nWhenever you see an addition involving a memory address,\nask yourself whether it is an integer addition or pointer addition\nand make sure the value being added is appropriately multiplied\nor not.\n\n\n\nExercise 11.\n    Implement the backtrace function as specified above.\n    Use the same format as in the example, since otherwise the\n    grading script will be confused.\n    When you think you have it working right,\n    run make grade to see if its output\n    conforms to what our grading script expects,\n    and fix it if it doesn't.\n    After you have handed in your Lab 1 code,\n    you are welcome to change the output format of the backtrace function\n    any way you like.\n\n\n\nAt this point, your backtrace function should give you the addresses of\nthe function callers on the stack that lead to mon_backtrace()\n\nbeing executed.  However, in practice you often want to know the function\nnames corresponding to those addresses.  For instance, you may want to know\nwhich functions could contain a bug that's causing your kernel to crash.\n\n\nThe final exercise will have you list the arguments to each\nfunction in the backtrace, if the funciton has any input values.\n\n\nOn x86-64, arguments are generally passed in registers.  \nIf funciton a calls function b, a may save some register values on the stack and reload them,\ndepending on whether a value will be reused.  These decisions\nare made by the compiler.\nThus, in order to find arguments on the stack, we need some help from \nthe compiler.\n\n\nWhen JOS is compiled with debugging flags, the compiler outputs \na variety of debugging information in the DWARF2 format.\nRead this article\nfor a brief introduction to DWARF and how debugging symbols work.\nThe key intuition is that DWARF gives the debugger (or monitor backtrace function)\nenough information to programmatically identify saved arguments on the stack.\n\n\n\nTo help you implement this functionality, we have provided the function\ndebuginfo_rip(), which looks up rip in the symbol table\nand returns the debugging information for that address.

Memory management has two components.\n\n\n\nThe first component is a physical memory allocator for the kernel,\nso that the kernel can allocate memory and later free it.\nYour allocator will operate in units of 4096 bytes, called\npages.\nYour task will be to maintain data structures that record\nwhich physical pages are free and which are\nallocated, and how many processes are sharing\neach allocated page.  You will also write the routines to allocate and\nfree pages of memory.\n\n\n\nThe second component of memory management is virtual memory,\nwhich maps the virtual addresses used by kernel and user software\nto addresses in physical memory.\nThe amd64 hardware's memory management unit (MMU) performs the\nmapping when instructions use memory, consulting a\nset of page tables.\nYou will modify JOS to set up the MMU's page tables\naccording to a specification we provide.\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nIn this and future labs you will progressively build up your kernel.\nWe will also provide you with some additional source.\nTo fetch that source, use Git to commit your Lab 1 source,\nfetch the latest version of the course repository,\nand then\ncreate a local branch called lab2 based on our lab2\nbranch, origin/lab2:\n\n\nkermit% git commit -am 'my solution to lab1'\nCreated commit 254dac5: my solution to lab1\n 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)\nkermit% git pull\n\nAlready up-to-date.\nkermit% git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2\nBranch lab2 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab2.\nSwitched to a new branch \"lab2\"\nkermit% \n\n\n\nThe git checkout -b command shown above actually does two\nthings: it first creates a local branch lab2 that is\nbased on the origin/lab2 branch provided by the course\nstaff, and second, it changes the contents of your lab\n\ndirectory to reflect the files stored on the lab2 branch.\nGit allows switching between existing branches using git\ncheckout branch-name, though you should commit any\noutstanding changes on one branch before switching to a different\none.\n\n\n\nYou will now need to merge the changes you made in your master (lab1)\nbranch into the lab2 branch, as follows:\n\n\n\nkermit% git merge lab1\nMerge made by recursive.\n kern/kdebug.c  |   11 +++++++++--\n kern/monitor.c |   19 +++++++++++++++++++\n lib/printfmt.c |    7 +++----\n 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)\nkermit% \n\n\nIn some cases, Git may not be able to figure out how to merge your changes with\nthe new lab assignment (e.g. if you modified some of the code that\nis changed in the second lab assignment).  In that case, the git\nmerge command will tell you which files are conflicted,\nand you should first resolve the conflict (by editing the relevant files)\nand then commit the resulting files with git commit -a.\n\n\n\nLab 2 contains the following new source files,\nwhich you should browse through:\n\n\n    inc/memlayout.h\n    kern/pmap.c\n    kern/pmap.h\n    kern/kclock.h\n\n    kern/kclock.c\n\n\n\n\nmemlayout.h describes the layout of the virtual\naddress space that you must implement by modifying pmap.c.\nmemlayout.h and pmap.h define the PageInfo\nstructure that you'll use to keep track of which pages of\nphysical memory are free.\n\nkclock.c and kclock.h\nmanipulate\nthe PC's battery-backed clock and CMOS RAM hardware,\nin which the BIOS records the amount of physical memory the PC contains,\namong other things.\nThe code in pmap.c needs to read this device hardware\nin order to figure out how much physical memory there is,\nbut that part of the code is done for you:\nyou do not need to know the details of how the CMOS hardware works.\n\n\n\nPay particular attention to memlayout.h and pmap.h,\nsince this lab requires you to use and understand many of the\ndefinitions they contain.  You may want to reviewinc/mmu.h,\ntoo, as it also contains a number of definitions that will be useful\nfor this lab.\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Physical Page Management\n\n\nThe operating system must keep track of\nwhich parts of physical RAM are free\nand which are currently in use.\nJOS manages the PC's physical memory\nwith page granularity\nso that it can use the MMU to map and protect each\npiece of allocated memory.\n\n\n\n\n    JOS is \"told\" the amount of physical memory it has by the\n    bootloader. JOS's bootloader passes the kernel a multiboot info\n    structure which possibly contains the physical memory map of the\n    system. The memory map may exclude regions of memory that are in use\n    for reasons including IO mappings for devices (e.g., the \"memory hole\"), space\n    reserved for the BIOS, or physically damaged memory.\n    For more details on how this structure looks and what it\n    contains, refer to the specification. A\n    typical physical memory map for a PC with 10 GB of memory looks\n    like below.\n\n    e820 MEMORY MAP\n    address: 0x0000000000000000, length: 0x000000000009f400, type: USABLE\n    address: 0x000000000009f400, length: 0x0000000000000c00, type: RESERVED\n    address: 0x00000000000f0000, length: 0x0000000000010000, type: RESERVED\n    address: 0x0000000000100000, length: 0x00000000dfefd000, type: USABLE\n    address: 0x00000000dfffd000, length: 0x0000000000003000, type: RESERVED\n    address: 0x00000000fffc0000, length: 0x0000000000040000, type: RESERVED\n    address: 0x0000000100000000, length: 0x00000001a0000000, type: USABLE\n\n\n\nYou'll now write the physical page allocator.  It keeps track of which\npages are free with a linked list of struct PageInfo objects,\neach corresponding to a physical page.  You need to write the physical\npage allocator before you can write the rest of the virtual memory\nimplementation, because your page table management code will need to\nallocate physical memory in which to store page tables.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.\n    In the file kern/pmap.c,\n    you must implement code for the following functions.\n\n    \n    boot_alloc()\n    page_init()\n    page_alloc()\n    page_free()\n        \n\n        You also need to add some code to x64_vm_init()\n        in pmap.c, as indicated by comments there. For now,\n        just add the code needed before the call to check_page_alloc().\n        \n        \n        You probably want to work on boot_alloc(),\n        then x64_vm_init(),\n        then\n    page_init(),\n    page_alloc(), and\n    page_free().\n        \n\n    \n    check_page_alloc() tests your physical page allocator.\n        You should boot JOS and see whether check_page_alloc()\n        reports success. Fix your code so that it passes. You may find it\n        helpful to add your own assert()s to verify that\n        your assumptions are correct.\n\n\n\nThis lab, and all the labs, will require you to do a bit of\ndetective work to figure out exactly what you need to do. This\nassignment does not describe all the details of the code you'll have\nto add to JOS.  Look for comments in the parts of the JOS source that\nyou have to modify; those comments often contain specifications and\nhints.  You will also need to look at related parts of JOS, at the\nIntel manuals, and perhaps at your notes from previous Operating Systems\ncourses.\n\nPart 2: Virtual Memory\n\n Aside: Contrast this to the VM layout for version 7 Unix on the\nPDP/11-40.  You will recall from lecture, that in v7, the kernel and\neach user process each have their own address spaces.\n\n-->\n\nBefore doing anything else,\nfamiliarize yourself with the AMD64's\nlong-mode memory management architecture:\nnamely segmentation and page translation.\n\n\n\n(self study)Exercise 2.\n    Read chapters 4 and 5 of the\n    \n\n    AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Reference Manual,\n    if you haven't done so already.\n    Read the sections about page\n    translation and page-based protection closely (5.1).\n    Although JOS relies most heavily on page translation,\n    you will also need a basic understanding\n    of how segmentation works in long mode\n    to understand what's going on in JOS.\n\n\nVirtual, Linear, and Physical Addresses\n\n\nIn AMD64 terminology,\na virtual address\nconsists of a segment selector and an offset within the segment.\nA linear address\nis what you get after segment translation but before page translation.\nA physical address\nis what you finally get after both segment and page translation and\nwhat ultimately goes out on the hardware bus to your RAM.\nBe sure you understand the difference\nbetween these three types or \"levels\" of addresses!\n\n\n\n\n           Selector  +--------------+         +-----------+\n          ---------->|              |         |           |\n                     | Segmentation |         |  Paging   |\nSoftware             |              |-------->|           |---------->  RAM\n            Offset   |  Mechanism   |         | Mechanism |\n          ---------->|              |         |           |\n                     +--------------+         +-----------+\n            Virtual                   Linear                Physical\n\n\n\n\nA C pointer is the \"offset\" component of the virtual address.\nIn kern/bootstrap.S, we installed a Global Descriptor Table (GDT)\nthat effectively disabled segment translation by setting all segment\nbase addresses to 0 and limits to 0xffffffff.  Hence the\n\"selector\" has no effect and the linear address always equals the\noffset of the virtual address.  In lab 3,\nwe'll have to interact a little more with segmentation to set up\nprivilege levels, but as for memory translation, we can\nignore segmentation throughout the JOS labs and focus solely on page\ntranslation.\n\n\n\nRecall that in kern/bootstrap.S of lab 1, we installed a simple page table \nin so that the kernel could run at its link address of 0x8004100000,\neven though it is actually loaded in physical memory\njust above the ROM BIOS at 0x00100000.  This page table mapped first 3GB\nof memory(VA=PA)and upper 256 MB of memory (VA-KERNBASE=PA).  \nNow we need to implement a set of page tables in C that JOS will manage.\n\n\n\nOur page tables will differ from the bootloader's simple page tables\nin several ways. \nMost notably, \nwe will use a 4 KB page size.  For simplicity, the bootloader\n        used a 2 MB page table.  As a result, in  boot1/head64.S,\n     the bootloader's page tables \n     have level-4 (PML4), level-3 (PDPE)\n     and level-2 (pgdir) but skip the last level of translation, i.e., the page table. \n     We will need to use four levels of translation in order to use a smaller\n     page size of 4 KB.  Note that there is a trade-off between\n     the granularity of the page size and the space overhead of the page tables.\n\n-->\n\n(Self study)Exercise 3.\n    While GDB can only access QEMU's memory by virtual address,\n    it's often useful to be able to inspect physical memory while\n    setting up virtual memory.  Review the QEMU monitor\n    commands from the lab tools guide, especially the\n    xp command, which lets\n    you inspect physical memory.  To access the QEMU monitor,\n    press Ctrl-a c in the terminal (the same binding\n    returns to the serial console).\n    \n\n    Use the xp command in the QEMU monitor and the\n    x command in GDB to inspect memory at corresponding\n    physical and virtual addresses and make sure you see the same\n    data.\n\n    Our patched version of QEMU provides an info pg\n    command that may also prove useful: it shows a compact but\n    detailed representation of the current page tables, including\n    all mapped memory ranges, permissions, and flags.  Stock QEMU\n    also provides an info mem command that shows an\n    overview of which ranges of virtual memory are mapped\n    and with what permissions.\n\n\nFrom code executing on the CPU, once we're in protected/long mode, there's no way to\ndirectly use a linear or physical address.  All memory\nreferences are interpreted as virtual addresses and translated by the\nMMU, which means all pointers in C are virtual addresses.\n\nThe JOS kernel often needs to manipulate addresses as opaque values\nor as integers, without dereferencing them, for example in the\nphysical memory allocator.  Sometimes these are virtual addresses,\nand sometimes they are physical addresses.  To help document the code, the\nJOS source distinguishes the two cases: the\ntype uintptr_t represents virtual addresses,\nand physaddr_t represents physical addresses.  Both these\ntypes are really just synonyms for 64-bit integers\n(uint64_t), so the compiler won't stop you from assigning\none type to another! Since they are integer types (not pointers), the\ncompiler will complain if you try to dereference them.\n\n\n\nThe JOS kernel can dereference a uintptr_t by first\ncasting it to a pointer type. In contrast,\nthe kernel can't sensibly dereference a physical\naddress, since the MMU translates all memory references.\nIf you cast a physaddr_t to a pointer and dereference it,\nyou may be able to load and store to the resulting address (the hardware\nwill interpret it as a virtual address), but you probably won't\nget the memory location you intended.\n\n\nTo summarize:\n\n\nC typeAddress type\n\nT*  Virtual\nuintptr_t  Virtual\nphysaddr_t  Physical\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n  Assuming that the\nfollowing JOS kernel code is correct, what type\nshould variable x have, uintptr_t or\n\nphysaddr_t?\n\n\n    mystery_t x;\n    char* value = return_a_pointer();\n    *value = 10;\n    x = (mystery_t) value;\n\n\n\n\nIn Part 3 of Lab 1 we noted that\nthe kernel's first step is to set up simple segmentation and paging (in kern/bootstrap.S)\nso that the kernel runs at its link address of 0x8004100000,\neven though it is actually loaded in physical memory\njust above the ROM BIOS at 0x00100000.\nIn other words,\nthe kernel's virtual starting address at this point is 0x8004100000,\nbut its physical starting address\nis 0x00100000.\nThe kernel's virtual and linear addresses are same because of the\nflat segmentation hardware in AMD64, while its linear and physical addresses differ\nbecause of the paging hardware (Remember we mapped the upper 256 MB 0xf000000 through\n0xffffffff back to 0x0 through 0xfffffff)\n\n\n\nIn the virtual memory layout you are going to rewrite the page tables in C.\nAs mentioned before this will be needed in some of the system-calls you \nwill be writing in Lab 4. It also serves the purpose of relocating your\npage tables above 1 MB physical memory where the JOS kernel resides. \n\n\n--!>\n\nIn the virtual memory layout you are going to set up for JOS in this\nlab, we will switch from using the x86 segmentation hardware for\nvirtual memory to using page translation instead.  Using page\ntranslation, we will accomplish the same virtual memory layout we\ncurrently use segmentation for, plus much more.  While we can't\nactually disable the segmentation hardware, we will stop using it for\nanything interesting, effectively disabling it by giving it segments\nwith zero offsets.  After you finish this lab\nand the JOS kernel successfully enables paging and \"disables\"\nsegmentation, the kernel's virtual and linear addresses will be the\nsame, while its linear and physical addresses will differ because of\npage translation.\n\n-->\n\n\nHowever, the JOS kernel sometimes needs to read or modify memory for which it\nonly knows the physical address. For example, adding a mapping to a\npage table may require allocating physical memory to store a page\ndirectory and then initializing that memory.  However, the kernel,\nlike any other software, cannot bypass virtual memory translation and thus\ncannot directly load and store to physical addresses. One reason JOS\nremaps of all of physical memory starting from physical address 0 at\nvirtual address\n0x8004000000 is to help the kernel read and write memory\nfor which it knows just the physical address.  In order to translate a\nphysical address into a virtual address that the kernel can actually\nread and write, the kernel must add 0x8004000000 to the\nphysical address to find its corresponding virtual address in the\nremapped region. You should use KADDR(pa) to do that\naddition.\n\n\n\nThe JOS kernel also sometimes needs to be able to find a physical\naddress given the virtual address of the memory in which a kernel data\nstructure is stored.  The\nkernel addresses its global variables and memory that\nboot_alloc() allocates, with addresses in the region\nwhere the kernel was loaded, starting at\n0x8004000000, the\nvery region where we mapped all of physical memory.\nThus, to turn a virtual address in this region into a physical\naddress, the kernel can simply\nsubtract 0x8004000000. You should use PADDR(va)\nto do that subtraction.\n\n\nReference counting\n\n\nIn future labs you will often have the same physical page mapped at\nmultiple virtual addresses simultaneously (or in the address spaces of\nmultiple environments).  You will keep a count of the number of\nreferences to each physical page in the pp_ref field of\nthe struct PageInfo corresponding to the physical page.  When\nthis count goes to zero for a physical page, that page can be freed\nbecause it is no longer used.  In general, this count should equal to the\nnumber of times the physical page appears below\nUTOP in all page tables (the mappings above\nUTOP are mostly set up at boot time by the kernel and\nshould never be freed, so there's no need to reference count them).\nWe'll also use it to keep track of the number of pointers we keep to\nthe page directory pages and, in turn, of the number of references the\npage directories have to page table pages.\n\n\n\nBe careful when using page_alloc.  The page it returns will\nalways have a reference count of 0, so pp_ref should be\nincremented as soon as you've done something with the returned page\n(like inserting it into a page table).  Sometimes this is handled by\nother functions (for example, page_insert) and sometimes the\nfunction calling page_alloc must do it directly.\n\n\n\nPage Table Management\n\n\nNow you'll write a set of routines to manage page tables: to insert\nand remove linear-to-physical mappings, and to create page table pages\nwhen needed.\n\n\n\nExercise 4.\n    In the file kern/pmap.c,\n    you must implement code for the following functions.\n\n    \n        pml4e_walk()\n        pdpe_walk()\n        pgdir_walk()\n        boot_map_region()\n        page_lookup()\n        page_remove()\n        page_insert()\n    \n        \n\n    page_check(), called from x64_vm_init(),\n        tests your page table management routines.\n        You should make sure it reports success before proceeding.\n\n\nPart 3: Kernel Address Space\n\n\nJOS divides the processor's linear address space\ninto two parts.\nUser environments (processes),\nwhich we will begin loading and running in lab 3,\nwill have control over the layout and contents of the lower part,\nwhile the kernel always maintains complete control over the upper part.\nThe dividing line is defined somewhat arbitrarily\nby the symbol ULIM in inc/memlayout.h,\nreserving approximately 256MB of linear (and therefore virtual) address space\nfor the kernel.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll find it helpful to refer to the JOS memory layout diagram in\ninc/memlayout.h both for this part and for later labs.\n\n\n\nPermissions and Fault Isolation\n\n\nSince kernel and user memory\nare both present in each environment's address space,\nwe will have to use permission bits in our amd64 page tables to\nallow user code access only to the user part of the address space.\nOtherwise bugs in user code might overwrite kernel data,\ncausing a crash or more subtle malfunction;\nuser code might also be able to steal other environments' private data.\n\n\nThe user environment will have no permission to any of the\nmemory above ULIM, while the kernel will be able to\nread and write this memory.  For the address range\n(UTOP,ULIM], both the kernel and the user environment have\nthe same permission: they can read but not write this address range.\nThis range of address is used to expose certain kernel data structures\nread-only to the user environment.  Lastly, the address space below\nUTOP is for the user environment to use; the user environment\nwill set permissions for accessing this memory.\n\n\n\nInitializing the Kernel Address Space\n\n\nNow you'll set up the address space above UTOP: the\nkernel part of the address space.  inc/memlayout.h shows\nthe layout you should use.  You'll use the functions you just wrote to\nset up the appropriate linear to physical mappings.\n\n\n\nExercise 5.\n\n    Fill in the missing code in x64_vm_init() after the\n        call to page_check().\n    \n        Your code should now pass the check_boot_pml4e() check.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n What entries (rows) in the page directory have been filled in\n     at this point for the 4th page directory pointer entry(Make sure you understand why 4th pdpe entry)?\n     What addresses do they map and where do they point? In other words, fill out this table as much as possible:\n     \n     Entry\n         Base Virtual Address\n         Points to (logically):\n\n     511?Page table for top 2MB of phys\n         memory\n     510??\n     .??\n     .??\n\n     .??\n     1840xF0000000?\n     20x00800000?\n     10x00400000?\n     00x00000000[see next question?]\n\n     \n After check_boot_pgdir(),\n     i386_vm_init() maps the first four MB of virtual\n     address space to the first four MB of physical memory,\n     then deletes this mapping at the end of the function.  Why is\n     this mapping necessary? What would happen if it were omitted? Does this\n     actually limit our kernel to be 4MB? What must be true if our\n     kernel were larger than 4MB?\n-->\n We have placed the kernel and user environment\nin the same address space.  Why will user programs not be able to\nread or write the kernel's memory? What specific mechanisms protect\nthe kernel memory?\n\n What is the maximum amount of physical memory that this operating\nsystem can support? Why?\n\n How much space overhead is there for managing memory, if we\nactually had the maximum amount of physical memory? How is this\noverhead broken down?\n\n Read the simple page table setup code in kern/bootstrap.S . \n\n    The bootloader tests whether the CPU supports long (64-bit) mode.\n    It initializes a simple set of page tables for the first 4GB of memory.\n    These pages map virtual addresses in the lowest 3GB to the same physical addresses,\n    and then map the upper 256 MB back to the lowest 256 MB of memory.\n    At this point, the bootloader places the CPU in long mode.\n    Note that our bootloader transitioning to long mode isn't strictly necessary;\n    typically, a bootloader only runs in long mode to load\n    a 64-bit kernel at a high (>4 GB) virtual memory address.\n    \n    Note that once we transfer control to the kernel, the kernel\n    assumes the CPU supports 64-bit mode.  Assuming the kernel was loaded \n    in the lower 4GB of virtual address space, \n    the kernel itself could test whether the CPU supports long mode\n    and determine dynamically whether to run in 64 or 32-bit mode.\n    Of course, this would substantially complicate the boot process.\n\n\n\n\n Is there a comparable mechanism on the PDP-11/40 which would\nprovide the fault isolation necessary to allow the kernel and the user\nenvironment to run in the same address space?  (read: \"same address space\"\nas \"with the same set of PARs/PDRs\")\n-->\n\n What constraint does the placement of the kernel in the virtual\n     address space place on the link address of user space programs?\n     In particular, think about how kernel growth or different amounts\n     of physical memory might affect available virtual address space.\n-->\n\n\n\nChallenge 1!

It may have subtle bugs that will\n   only be tickled by future labs.\n   All your kernel code is running in the same address space with no protection.\n   If you get weird crashes\n   that don't seem to be explainable by a bug in the crashing code,\n   it's likely that they're due to a bug somewhere else that is\n   modifying memory used by the crashing code.\n\nInline Assembly\n\n   In this lab you may find GCC's inline assembly language feature useful,\n   although it is also possible to complete the lab without using it.\n   At the very least, you will need to be able to understand\n   the fragments of inline assembly language (\"asm\" statements)\n   that already exist in the source code we gave you.\n   You can find several sources of information\n   on GCC inline assembly language\n   on the class reference materials page.\n\nPart A: User Environments and Exception Handling\n\n   The new include file inc/env.h\n   contains basic definitions for user environments in JOS;\n   read it now.\n   The kernel uses the Env data structure\n   to keep track of each user environment.\n   In this lab you will initially create just one environment,\n   but you will need to design the JOS kernel\n   to support multiple environments;\n   lab 4 will take advantage of this feature\n   by allowing a user environment to fork other environments.\n\n\n   As you can see in kern/env.c,\n   the kernel maintains three main global variables\n   pertaining to environments:\n\n\nstruct Env *envs = NULL;        /* All environments */\nstruct Env *curenv = NULL;            /* the current env */\nstatic struct Env_list env_free_list;    /* Free list */\n\n\n   Once JOS gets up and running,\n   the envs pointer points to an array of Env structures\n   representing all the environments in the system.\n   In our design,\n   the JOS kernel will support a maximum of NENV\n   simultaneously active environments,\n   although there will typically be far fewer running environments\n   at any given time.\n   (NENV is a constant #define'd in inc/env.h.)\n   Once it is allocated,\n   the envs array will contain\n   a single instance of the Env data structure\n   for each of the NENV possible environments.\n\n\n   The JOS kernel keeps all of the inactive Env structures\n   on the env_free_list.\n   This design allows easy allocation and\n   deallocation of environments,\n   as they merely have to be added to or removed from the free list.\n\n\n   The kernel uses the curenv variable\n   to keep track of the currently executing environment at any given time.\n   During boot up, before the first environment is run,\n   curenv is initially set to NULL.\n\nEnvironment State\n\n   The Env structure\n   is defined in inc/env.h as follows\n   (although more fields will be added in future labs):\n\n\nstruct Env {\n    struct Trapframe env_tf;        // Saved register\n    struct Env *env_link;        // Next free Env\n    envid_t env_id;                 // Unique environment identifier\n    envid_t env_parent_id;          // env_id of this env's parent\n    enum EnvType env_type;        // Indicates special system environments\n    unsigned env_status;            // Status of the environment\n    uint32_t env_runs;              // Number of times environment has run\n    // Address space\n    pml4e_t *env_pml4e;               // Kernel virtual address of page map level-4\n};\n\n\n   Here's what the Env fields are for:\n\n\n   env_tf:\n       This structure, defined in inc/trap.h,\n      holds the saved register values for the environment\n      while that environment is not running:\n      i.e., when the kernel or a different environment is running.\n      The kernel saves these when\n      switching from user to kernel mode,\n      so that the environment can later be resumed where it left off.\n   \n   env_link:\n       This is a link to the next Env on the\n      env_free_list.  env_free_list points\n      to the first free environment on the list.\n   \n   env_id:\n       The kernel stores here a value\n      that uniquely identifiers\n      the environment currently using this Env structure\n      (i.e., using this particular slot in the envs array).\n      After a user environment terminates,\n      the kernel may re-allocate\n      the same Env structure to a different environment -\n      but the new environment\n      will have a different env_id from the old one\n      even though the new environment\n      is re-using the same slot in the envs array.\n   \n   env_parent_id:\n       The kernel stores here the env_id\n      of the environment that created this environment.\n      In this way the environments can form a ``family tree,''\n      which will be useful for making security decisions\n      about which environments are allowed to do what to whom.\n   \n   env_type:\n       This is used to distinguish special environments.  For most\n      environments, it will be ENV_TYPE_USER.  The idle\n      environment is ENV_TYPE_IDLE and we'll introduce\n      a few more special types for special system service\n      environments in later labs.\n   \n   env_status:\n   \n      This variable holds one of the following values:\n      \n         ENV_FREE:\n             Indicates that the Env structure is inactive,\n            and therefore on the env_free_list.\n         \n         ENV_RUNNABLE:\n             Indicates that the Env structure\n            represents a currently active environment,\n            and the environment is waiting to run on the processor.\n         \n         ENV_RUNNING:\n             Indicates that the Env structure\n            represents the currently running environment.\n         \n         ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE:\n             Indicates that the Env structure\n            represents a currently active environment,\n            but it is not currently ready to run:\n            for example, because it is waiting\n            for an interprocess communication (IPC)\n            from another environment.\n         \n         ENV_DYING:\n             Indicates that the Env structure\n            represents a zombie environment. A zombie environment will be\n            freed the next time it traps to the kernel. We will not use\n            this flag until Lab 4.\n         \n      \n   \n   env_pml4e:\n       This variable holds the kernel virtual address \n      of this environment's top-level (4th level) page directory.\n   \n\n\n   Like a Unix process, a JOS environment couples the concepts of\n   \"thread\" and \"address space\".  The thread is defined primarily by the\n   saved registers (the env_tf field), and the address space\n   is defined by the PML4,page directory pointer, page directory and page tables pointed to by\n   env_pml4e and env_cr3.  To run an\n   environment, the kernel must set up the CPU with both the saved\n   registers and the appropriate address space.\n\n\n   Note that in Unix-like systems, individual environments have their own\n   kernel stacks. In JOS, however, only one environment can be active in\n   the kernel at once, so JOS needs only a single kernel stack.\n\nstruct Env is analogous to struct proc\n   in xv6.  Both structures hold the environment's (i.e., process's)\n   user-mode register state in a Trapframe\n   structure.  In JOS,\n   individual environments do not have their own kernel stacks as\n   processes do in xv6.  There can be only JOS environment active in\n   the kernel at a time, so JOS needs only a\n   single kernel stack.\n   \n   -->\nAllocating the Environments Array\n\n   In lab 2,\n   you allocated memory in x86_vm_init()\n   for the pages[] array,\n   which is a table the kernel uses to keep track of\n   which pages are free and which are not.\n   You will now need to modify x64_vm_init() further\n   to allocate a similar array of Env structures,\n   called envs.\n\n\n   Exercise 1.\n      Modify x64_vm_init() in kern/pmap.c\n      to allocate and map the envs array.\n      This array consists of\n      exactly NENV instances of the Env\n      structure allocated much like how you allocated the\n      pages array.\n      Also like the pages array, the memory backing\n      envs should also be mapped user read-only at\n      UENVS (defined in inc/memlayout.h) so\n      user processes can read from this array.\n   \n   \n      You should run your code and make sure\n      check_boot_pml4e() succeeds.\n   \n\nCreating and Running Environments\n\n   You will now write the code in kern/env.c necessary to run a\n   user environment.  Because we do not yet have a filesystem, we will\n   set up the kernel to load a static binary image that is embedded\n   within the kernel itself. JOS embeds\n   this binary in the kernel as a ELF executable image.\n\n\n   The Lab 3 GNUmakefile generates a number of binary images in\n   the obj/user/ directory.  If you look at\n   kern/Makefrag, you will notice some magic that \"links\" these\n   binaries directly into the kernel executable as if they were\n   .o files.  The -b binary option on the linker\n   command line causes these files to be linked in as \"raw\" uninterpreted\n   binary files rather than as regular .o files produced by the\n   compiler.  (As far as the linker is concerned, these files do not have\n   to be ELF images at all - they could be anything, such as text files\n   or pictures!)  If you look at obj/kern/kernel.sym after\n   building the kernel, you will notice that the linker has \"magically\"\n   produced a number of funny symbols with obscure names like\n   _binary_obj_user_hello_start,\n   _binary_obj_user_hello_end, and\n   _binary_obj_user_hello_size.  The linker generates these\n   symbol names by mangling the file names of the binary files; the\n   symbols provide the regular kernel code with a way to reference the\n   embedded binary files.\n\n\n   In i386_init() in kern/init.c you'll see code to run\n   one of these binary images in an environment.  However, the critical\n   functions to set up user environments are not complete; you will need\n   to fill them in.\n\n\n   Exercise 2.\n      In the file env.c,\n      finish coding the following functions:\n   \n   \n          env_init():\n          Initialize all of the Env structures\n         in the envs array\n         and add them to the env_free_list.\n         Also calls env_init_percpu, which\n         configures the segmentation hardware with\n         separate segments for privilege level 0 (kernel) and\n         privilege level 3 (user).\n      \n          env_setup_vm():\n          Allocate a page map level four (pml4e) for a new environment\n         and initialize the kernel portion\n         of the new environment's address space.\n         Note that in the previous lab, we set up our memory mapping such that everything above UTOP is in the second entry of the PML4. Everything above UTOP needs to be mapped into every environment's virtual space. This involves simple copying of this entry form kernel's pml4 to the environment's pml4.\n      \n          region_alloc():\n          Allocates and maps physical memory for an environment\n          load_icode():\n          You will need to parse an ELF binary image,\n         much like the boot loader already does,\n         and load its contents into the user address space\n         of a new environment.\n      \n          env_create():\n          Allocate an environment with env_alloc\n         and call load_icode load an ELF binary into it.\n      \n          env_run():\n          Start a given environment running in user mode.\n   \n   \n      As you write these functions,\n      you might find the new cprintf verb %e\n      useful -- it prints a description corresponding to an error code.\n      For example,\n   \n   \n    r = -E_NO_MEM;\n    panic(\"env_alloc: %e\", r);\n    \n   \n      will panic with the message \"env_alloc: out of memory\".\n   \n\n\n   Below is a call graph of the code up to the point where the user\n   code is invoked. \n   Make sure you understand the purpose of each step.\n\n\n    start (kern/entry.S)\n   \n      i386_init\n      \n          cons_init\n          x86_vm_init\n          env_init\n          trap_init (still incomplete at this point)\n          env_create\n         \n            env_run\n            \n                env_pop_tf\n            \n         \n      \n   \n\n\n   Once you are done you should compile your kernel and run it under QEMU.\n   If all goes well, your system should enter user space and execute the\n   hello binary until it makes a system call with the\n   int instruction.  At that point there will be trouble, since\n   JOS has not set up the hardware to allow any kind of transition\n   from user space into the kernel.\n   When the CPU discovers that it is not set up to handle this system\n   call interrupt, it will generate a general protection exception, find\n   that it can't handle that, generate a double fault exception, find\n   that it can't handle that either, and finally give up, reset, and\n   reboot in what's known as a \"triple fault\".  \n   Usually, you would then see the CPU reset\n   and the system reboot.  While this is important for legacy\n   applications (see \n   this blog post for an explanation of why), it's a pain for kernel\n   development.\n   \n\n\n   We'll address this problem shortly, but for now we can use the\n   debugger to check that we're entering user mode.  Use make\n   qemu-gdb (or make qemu-nox-gdb) and set a GDB breakpoint \n   at env_pop_tf,\n   which should be the last function you hit before actually entering user mode.\n   Single step through this function using si;\n   the processor should enter user mode after the iret instruction.\n   You should then see the first instruction\n   in the user environment's executable,\n   which is the cmpl instruction at the label start\n   in lib/entry.S.\n   Now use b *0x... to set a breakpoint at the\n   int $0x30 in sys_cputs() in hello\n   (see obj/user/hello.asm for the user-space address).\n   This int is the system call to display a character to\n   the console.\n   If you cannot execute as far as the int,\n   then something is wrong with your address space setup\n   or program loading code;\n   go back and fix it before continuing.\n\nHandling Interrupts and Exceptions\n\n   At this point,\n   the first int $0x30 system call instruction in user space\n   is a dead end:\n   once the processor gets into user mode,\n   there is no way to get back out.\n   You will now need to implement\n   basic exception and system call handling,\n   so that it is possible for the kernel to recover control of the processor\n   from user-mode code.\n   The first thing you should do\n   is thoroughly familiarize yourself with\n   the x86 interrupt and exception mechanism.\n\n\n   Exercise 3.\n      Read\n      \n      Chapter 9, Exceptions and Interrupts\n      in the\n      80386 Programmer's Manual\n      if you haven't already.\n   \n\n\n   In this lab we generally follow Intel's terminology\n   for interrupts, exceptions, and the like.\n   However,\n   terms such as exception, trap, interrupt, fault and\n   abort have no standard meaning\n   across architectures or operating systems,\n   and are often used without regard to the subtle distinctions between them\n   on a particular architecture such as the x86.\n   When you see these terms outside of this lab,\n   the meanings might be slightly different.\n\nBasics of Protected Control Transfer\n\n   Exceptions and interrupts are both\n   \"protected control transfers,\"\n   which cause the processor to switch from user to kernel mode\n   (CPL=0) without giving the user-mode code any opportunity\n   to interfere with the functioning of the kernel or other environments.\n   In Intel's terminology,\n   an interrupt is a protected control transfer\n   that is caused by an asynchronous event usually external to the processor,\n   such as notification of external device I/O activity.\n   An exception, in contrast,\n   is a protected control transfer\n   caused synchronously by the currently running code,\n   for example due to a divide by zero or an invalid memory access.\n\n\n   In order to ensure that these protected control transfers\n   are actually protected,\n   the processor's interrupt/exception mechanism is designed so that\n   the code currently running when the interrupt or exception occurs\n   does not get to choose arbitrarily where the kernel is entered or how.\n   Instead,\n   the processor ensures that the kernel can be entered\n   only under carefully controlled conditions.\n   On the x86, two mechanisms provide this protection:\n\n\n   \n          The Interrupt Descriptor Table.\n         The processor ensures that interrupts and exceptions\n         can only cause the kernel to be entered\n         at a few specific, well-defined entry-points\n         determined by the kernel itself,\n         and not by the code running\n         when the interrupt or exception is taken.\n      \n      \n         The x86 allows up to 256 different\n         interrupt or exception entry points into the kernel,\n         each with a different interrupt vector.\n         A vector is a number between 0 and 255.\n         An interrupt's vector is determined by the\n         source of the interrupt: different devices, error\n         conditions, and application requests to the kernel\n         generate interrupts with different vectors.\n         The CPU uses the vector as an index\n         into the processor's interrupt descriptor table (IDT),\n         which the kernel sets up in kernel-private memory,\n         much like the GDT.\n         From the appropriate entry in this table\n         the processor loads:\n      \n      \n             the value to load into\n            the instruction pointer (RIP) register,\n            pointing to the kernel code designated\n            to handle that type of exception.\n         \n             the value to load into\n            the code segment (CS) register,\n            which includes in bits 0-1 the privilege level\n            at which the exception handler is to run.\n            (In JOS, all exceptions are handled in kernel mode,\n            privilege level 0.)\n         \n      \n   \n   \n          The Task State Segment.\n         The processor needs a place\n         to save the old processor state\n         before the interrupt or exception occurred,\n         such as the original values of RIP and CS\n         before the processor invoked the exception handler,\n         so that the exception handler can later restore that old state\n         and resume the interrupted code from where it left off.\n         But this save area for the old processor state\n         must in turn be protected from unprivileged user-mode code;\n         otherwise buggy or malicious user code\n         could compromise the kernel.\n      \n      \n         For this reason,\n         when an x86 processor takes an interrupt or trap\n         that causes a privilege level change from user to kernel mode,\n         it also switches to a stack in the kernel's memory.\n         A structure called the task state segment (TSS) specifies\n         the segment selector and address where this stack lives.\n         The processor pushes (on this new stack)\n         SS, RSP, EFLAGS, CS, RIP, and an optional error code.\n         Then it loads the CS and RIP from the interrupt descriptor,\n         and sets the RSP and SS to refer to the new stack.\n      \n      \n         Although the TSS is large\n         and can potentially serve a variety of purposes,\n         JOS only uses it to define\n         the kernel stack that the processor should switch to\n         when it transfers from user to kernel mode.\n         Since \"kernel mode\" in JOS\n         is privilege level 0 on the x86,\n         the processor uses the RSP0 and SS0 fields of the TSS\n         to define the kernel stack when entering kernel mode.\n         JOS doesn't use any other TSS fields.\n      \n   \n\nTypes of Exceptions and Interrupts\n\n   All of the synchronous exceptions\n   that the x86 processor can generate internally\n   use interrupt vectors between 0 and 31,\n   and therefore map to IDT entries 0-31.\n   For example,\n   a page fault always causes an exception through vector 14.\n   Interrupt vectors greater than 31 are only used by\n   software interrupts,\n   which can be generated by the int instruction, or\n   asynchronous hardware interrupts,\n   caused by external devices when they need attention.\n\n\n   In this section we will extend JOS to handle\n   the internally generated x86 exceptions in vectors 0-31.\n   In the next section we will make JOS handle\n   software interrupt vector 48 (0x30),\n   which JOS (fairly arbitrarily) uses as its system call interrupt vector.\n   In Lab 4 we will extend JOS to handle externally generated hardware interrupts\n   such as the clock interrupt.\n\nAn Example\n\n   Let's put these pieces together and trace through an example.\n   Let's say the processor is executing code in a user environment\n   and encounters a divide instruction that attempts to divide by zero.\n\n\n       The processor switches to the stack defined by the\n      SS0 and RSP0 fields of the TSS,\n      which in JOS will hold the values\n      GD_KD and KSTACKTOP, respectively.\n   \n   \n      The processor pushes the exception parameters on the\n      kernel stack, starting at address KSTACKTOP:\n      \n                     +--------------------+ KSTACKTOP     \n                     | 0x00000 | old SS   |     \" - 8\n                     |      old RSP       |     \" - 16\n                     |     old EFLAGS     |     \" - 24\n                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     \" - 32\n                     |      old RIP       |     \" - 40 \n   \n       Because we're handling a divide error,\n      which is interrupt vector 0 on the x86,\n      the processor reads IDT entry 0 and sets\n      CS:RIP to point to the handler function defined there.\n   \n       The handler function takes control and handles the exception,\n      for example by terminating the user environment.\n   \n\n\n   For certain types of x86 exceptions,\n   in addition to the \"standard\" five words above,\n   the processor pushes onto the stack another word\n   containing an error code.\n   The page fault exception, number 14,\n   is an important example.\n   See the 80386 manual to determine for which exception numbers\n   the processor pushes an error code,\n   and what the error code means in that case.\n   When the processor pushes an error code,\n   the stack would look as follows at the beginning of the exception handler\n   when coming in from user mode:\n\n\n                     +--------------------+ KSTACKTOP             \n                     | 0x00000 | old SS   |     \" - 8\n                     |      old RSP       |     \" - 16\n                     |     old EFLAGS     |     \" - 24\n                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     \" - 32\n                     |      old RIP       |     \" - 40\n                     |     error code     |     \" - 48 \nNested Exceptions and Interrupts\n\n   The processor can take exceptions and interrupts\n   both from kernel and user mode.\n   It is only when entering the kernel from user mode, however,\n   that the x86 processor automatically switches stacks\n   before pushing its old register state onto the stack\n   and invoking the appropriate exception handler through the IDT.\n   If the processor is already in kernel mode\n   when the interrupt or exception occurs\n   (the low 2 bits of the CS register are already zero),\n   then the kernel just pushes more values on the same kernel stack.\n   In this way, the kernel can gracefully handle nested exceptions\n   caused by code within the kernel itself.\n   This capability is an important tool in implementing protection,\n   as we will see later in the section on system calls.\n\n\n   If the processor is already in kernel mode\n   and takes a nested exception,\n   since it does not need to switch stacks,\n   it does not save the old SS or RSP registers.\n   For exception types that do not push an error code,\n   the kernel stack therefore looks like the following\n   on entry to the exception handler:\n\n\n                     +--------------------+ \n\n   For exception types that push an error code,\n   the processor pushes the error code immediately after the old RIP,\n   as before.\n\n\n   There is one important caveat to the processor's nested exception capability.\n   If the processor takes an exception while already in kernel mode,\n   and cannot push its old state onto the kernel stack for any reason\n   such as lack of stack space,\n   then there is nothing the processor can do to recover,\n   so it simply resets itself.\n   Needless to say, the kernel should be designed so that this can't happen.\n\nSetting Up the IDT\n\n   You should now have the basic information you need\n   in order to set up the IDT and handle exceptions in JOS.\n   For now, you will set up the IDT to handle \n   interrupt vectors 0-31 (the processor exceptions)\n   and interrupts 32-47 (the device IRQs).\n\n\n   The header files inc/trap.h and kern/trap.h\n   contain important definitions related to interrupts and exceptions\n   that you will need to become familiar with.\n   The file kern/trap.h contains definitions\n   that are strictly private to the kernel,\n   while inc/trap.h\n   contains definitions that may also be useful\n   to user-level programs and libraries.\n\n\n   Note:\n   Some of the exceptions in the range 0-31 are defined by Intel to be\n   reserved.\n   Since they will never be generated by the processor,\n   it doesn't really matter how you handle them.\n   Do whatever you think is cleanest.\n\n\n   The overall flow of control that you should achieve is depicted below: \n\n\n      IDT                   trapentry.S         trap.c\n\n+----------------+                        \n|   &handler1    |---------> handler1:

 // undo stuff    }\n+----------------+\n|   &handler2    |--------> handler2:\n|                |            // do stuff\n|                |            call trap\n|                |            //

trap\n|                |             // undo stuff\n+----------------+\n\n\n   Each exception or interrupt should have\n   its own handler in trapentry.S\n   and trap_init() should initialize the IDT with the addresses\n   of these handlers.\n   Each of the handlers should build a struct Trapframe\n   (see inc/trap.h) on the stack and call \n   trap() (in trap.c)\n   with a pointer to the Trapframe.\n\n\n   trap() handles the\n   exception/interrupt or dispatches to a specific\n   handler function.\n   If and when trap() returns,\n   the code in trapentry.S\n   restores the old CPU state saved in the Trapframe\n   and then uses the iret instruction\n   to return from the exception.\n\n\n   Exercise 4.\n      Edit trapentry.S and trap.c and\n      implement the features described above.  The macros\n      TRAPHANDLER and TRAPHANDLER_NOEC in\n      trapentry.S should help you, as well as the T_*\n      defines in inc/trap.h.  You will need to add an\n      entry point in trapentry.S (using those macros)\n      for each trap defined in inc/trap.h, and\n      you'll have to provide _alltraps which the\n      TRAPHANDLER macros refer to.  You will\n      also need to modify trap_init() to initialize the\n      idt to point to each of these entry points\n      defined in trapentry.S; the SETGATE\n      macro will be helpful here.\n   \n   \n      Hint: your _alltraps should:\n   \n   \n      push values to make the stack look like a struct Trapframe\n      load GD_KD into %ds and %es\n      Pass a pointer to the Trapframe as an argument to trap() (Hint: Review the x64 calling convention from lab 1).\n      call trap (can trap ever return?)\n   \n   \n      Consider using the PUSHA and POPA\n      macros; they fit nicely with the layout of the struct\n      Trapframe.\n   \n   Be sure to initialize every possible trap entry to a default handler (T_DEFAULT).\n   \n      Test your trap handling code\n      using some of the test programs in the user directory\n      that cause exceptions before making any system calls,\n      such as user/divzero.\n      You should be able to get make grade\n      to succeed on the divzero, softint,\n      and badsegment tests at this point.\n   \n   Important note: Be very careful not to \n      declare your trap handling functions (defined by a\n      TRAPHANDLER or TRAPHANDLER_NOEC macro)\n      with a name already in use in the code.  In your C code,\n      these will likely be declared as extern,\n      which disables the compiler checking for conflicting symbol names---the        \n      compiler instead just picks the first instance of a symbol it finds.\n   \n   \n      For instance, the function breakpoint\n      is already defined in inc/x86.h, and the compiler will \n      not warn you about this if you also call your breakpoint\n      trap handler breakpoint; rather, the compiler\n      will likely pick the wrong function.\n      For this reason, one strategy might be to pick a random prefix for \n      all traphandlers, like XTRPX_divzero, XTRPX_pgfault, etc.\n   \n\n\n   Challenge 1! (2 bonus points)\n      You probably have a lot of very similar code\n      right now, between the lists of TRAPHANDLER in\n      trapentry.S and their installations in\n      trap.c.  Clean this up.  Change the macros in\n      trapentry.S to automatically generate a table for\n      trap.c to use.  Note that you can switch between\n      laying down code and data in the assembler by using the\n      directives .text and .data.\n   \n-->\n\n   Questions\n\n   \n   Answer the following questions:\n   \n   \n   \n       What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for\n       each exception/interrupt?  (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were\n       delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in\n       the current implementation could not be provided?)\n       Did you have to do anything\n       to make the user/softint program behave correctly?\n       The grade script expects it to produce a general protection\n       fault (trap 13), but softint's code says\n       int $14.\n       Why should this produce interrupt vector 13?\n       What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's\n       int $14 instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler\n       (which is interrupt vector 14)?\n\n   \n   \n   -->\n\n   This completes part A.\n\nPart B: Page Faults, Breakpoints Exceptions, and System Calls\n\n   Now that your kernel has basic exception handling capabilities,\n   you will refine it to provide important operating system primitives\n   that depend on exception handling.\n\nHandling Page Faults\n\n   The page fault exception, interrupt vector 14 (T_PGFLT),\n   is a particularly important one that we will exercise heavily\n   throughout this lab and the next.\n   When the processor takes a page fault,\n   it stores the linear address that caused the fault\n   in a special processor control register, CR2.\n   In trap.c\n   we have provided the beginnings of a special function,\n   page_fault_handler(),\n   to handle page fault exceptions.\n\n\n   Exercise 5.\n      Modify trap_dispatch()\n      to dispatch page fault exceptions\n      to page_fault_handler().\n      You should now be able to get make grade\n      to succeed on the faultread, faultreadkernel,\n      faultwrite, and faultwritekernel tests.\n      If any of them don't work, figure out why and fix them.\n      Remember that you can boot JOS into a particular user program\n      using make run-x or make run-x-nox.\n   \n\n\n   You will further refine the kernel's page fault handling below,\n   as you implement system calls.\n\nThe Breakpoint Exception\n\n   The breakpoint exception, interrupt vector 3 (T_BRKPT),\n   is normally used to allow debuggers\n   to insert breakpoints in a program's code\n   by temporarily replacing the relevant program instruction\n   with the special 1-byte int3 software interrupt instruction.\n   In JOS we will abuse this exception slightly\n   by turning it into a primitive pseudo-system call\n   that any user environment can use to invoke the JOS kernel monitor.\n   This usage is actually somewhat appropriate\n   if we think of the JOS kernel monitor as a primitive debugger.\n   The user-mode implementation of panic() in lib/panic.c,\n   for example,\n   performs an int3 after displaying its panic message.\n\n\n   Exercise 6.\n      Modify trap_dispatch()\n      to make breakpoint exceptions invoke the kernel monitor.\n      You should now be able to get make grade\n      to succeed on the breakpoint test.\n   \n\n\n   Challenge 2! (5 bonus points; mega-bragging rights for a good disassembler)\n      Modify the JOS kernel monitor so that\n      you can 'continue' execution from the current location\n      (e.g., after the int3,\n      if the kernel monitor was invoked via the breakpoint exception),\n      and so that you can single-step one instruction at a time.\n      You will need to understand certain bits\n      of the EFLAGS register\n      in order to implement single-stepping.\n   \n   Optional:\n      If you're feeling really adventurous,\n      find some x86 disassembler source code -\n      e.g., by ripping it out of QEMU,\n      or out of GNU binutils, or just write it yourself -\n      and extend the JOS kernel monitor\n      to be able to disassemble and display instructions\n      as you are stepping through them.\n      Combined with the symbol table loading \n      from lab 2,\n      this is the stuff of which real kernel debuggers are made.\n   \n-->\n\n   Questions\n   \n          The break point test case will either generate a break point\n         exception or a general protection fault depending on how you initialized\n         the break point entry in the IDT (i.e., your call to\n         SETGATE from trap_init).  Why?\n         How do you need to set it up in order to get the breakpoint exception\n         to work as specified above and what incorrect setup would\n         cause it to trigger a general protection fault?\n      \n          What do you think is the point of these mechanisms,\n         particularly in light of\n         what the user/softint test program does?\n      \n   \n\nSystem calls\n\n   User processes ask the kernel to do things for them by\n   invoking system calls.  When the user process invokes a system call,\n   the processor enters kernel mode,\n   the processor and the kernel cooperate\n   to save the user process's state,\n   the kernel executes appropriate code in order to carry out the system\n   call, and then resumes the user process.  The exact\n   details of how the user process gets the kernel's attention\n   and how it specifies which call it wants to execute vary\n   from system to system.\n\n\n   In V6, user processes executed the sys instruction\n   to get the kernel's attention.\n   The user process specifies the type of system call\n   with a constant in the instruction itself.  The\n   arguments to the system call are also in the instruction\n   stream, or in registers, or on the stack, or some combination\n   of the three.  The kernel passes the return value\n   back to the user process in r0.\n   \n   -->\n\n   In the JOS kernel, we will use the int\n   instruction, which causes a processor interrupt.\n   In particular, we will use int $0x30\n   as the system call interrupt.\n   We have defined the constant\n   T_SYSCALL to 48 (0x30) for you.  You will have to\n   set up the interrupt descriptor to allow user processes to\n   cause that interrupt.  Note that interrupt 0x30 cannot be\n   generated by hardware, so there is no ambiguity caused by\n   allowing user code to generate it.\n\n\n   The application will pass the system call number and\n   the system call arguments in registers.  This way, the kernel won't\n   need to grub around in the user environment's stack\n   or instruction stream.  The\n   system call number will go in %rax, and the\n   arguments (up to five of them) will go in %rdx,\n   %rcx, %rbx, %rdi,\n   and %rsi, respectively.  The kernel passes the\n   return value back in %eax.  The assembly code to\n   invoke a system call has been written for you, in\n   syscall() in lib/syscall.c.  You\n   should read through it and make sure you understand what\n   is going on.\n\n\n   Exercise 7.\n      Add a handler in the kernel\n      for interrupt vector T_SYSCALL.\n      You will have to edit kern/trapentry.S and\n      kern/trap.c's trap_init().  You\n      also need to change trap_dispatch() to handle the\n      system call interrupt by calling syscall()\n      (defined in kern/syscall.c)\n      with the appropriate arguments,\n      and then arranging for\n      the return value to be passed back to the user process\n      in %eax.\n      Finally, you need to implement syscall() in\n      kern/syscall.c.\n      Make sure syscall() returns -E_INVAL\n      if the system call number is invalid.\n      You should read and understand lib/syscall.c\n      (especially the inline assembly routine) in order to confirm\n      your understanding of the system call interface.\n      You may also find it helpful to read inc/syscall.h.\n   \n   \n      Run the user/hello program under your kernel.\n      It should print \"hello, world\" on the console\n      and then cause a page fault in user mode.\n      If this does not happen, it probably means\n      your system call handler isn't quite right.\n      You should also now be able to get make grade\n      to succeed on the testbss test.\n   \n\n\n   Challenge 3! (10 bonus points)\n      Implement system calls using the sysenter and\n      sysexit instructions instead of using\n      int 0x30 and iret. \n   \n   \n      The sysenter/sysexit instructions were designed\n      by Intel to be faster than int/iret.  They do\n      this by using registers instead of the stack and by making\n      assumptions about how the segmentation registers are used.\n      The exact details of these instructions can be found in Volume\n      2B of the Intel reference manuals.\n   \n   \n      The easiest way to add support for these instructions in JOS\n      is to add a sysenter_handler in\n      kern/trapentry.S that saves enough information about\n      the user environment to return to it, sets up the kernel\n      environment, pushes the arguments to\n      syscall() and calls syscall()\n      directly.  Once syscall() returns, set everything\n      up for and execute the sysexit instruction.\n      You will also need to add code to kern/init.c to\n      set up the necessary model specific registers (MSRs).  Section\n      6.1.2 in Volume 2 of the AMD Architecture Programmer's Manual\n      and the reference on SYSENTER in Volume 2B of the Intel\n      reference manuals give good descriptions of the relevant MSRs.\n      You can find an implementation of wrmsr to add to\n      inc/x86.h for writing to these MSRs here.\n   \n   \n      Finally, lib/syscall.c must be changed to support\n      making a system call with sysenter.  Here is a\n      possible register layout for the sysenter\n      instruction:\n   \n   \n    rax                - syscall number\n    rdx, rcx, rbx, rdi - arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4\n    rsi                - return pc\n    rbp                - return rsp\n    rsp                - trashed by sysenter\n   \n   \n      GCC's inline assembler will automatically save registers that\n      you tell it to load values directly into.  Don't forget to\n      either save (push) and restore (pop) other registers that you\n      clobber, or tell the inline assembler that you're clobbering\n      them.  The inline assembler doesn't support saving\n      %rbp, so you will need to add code to save and\n      restore it yourself.  The return\n      address can be put into %esi by using an\n      instruction like leal after_sysenter_label,\n      %%esi.\n   \n   \n      Note that this only supports 4 arguments, so you will need to\n      leave the old method of doing system calls around\n      to support 5 argument system calls.  Furthermore, because this\n      fast path doesn't update the current environment's trap frame,\n      it won't be suitable for some of the system calls we add in\n      later labs.\n   \n   \n      You may have to revisit your code once we enable asynchronous\n      interrupts in the next lab.  Specifically, you'll need to\n      enable interrupts when returning to the user process, which\n      sysexit doesn't do for you.\n   \n-->\nUser-mode startup\n\n   A user program starts running at the top of\n   lib/entry.S.  After some setup, this code\n   calls libmain(), in lib/libmain.c.\n   You should modify libmain() to initialize the global pointer\n   env to point at this environment's\n   struct Env in the envs[] array.\n   (Note that lib/entry.S has already defined envs\n   to point at the UENVS mapping you set up in Part A.)\n   Hint: look in inc/env.h and use\n   sys_getenvid.\n\n\n   libmain() then calls umain, which,\n   in the case of the hello program, is in\n   user/hello.c.  Note that after printing\n   \"hello, world\", it tries to access\n   env->env_id.  This is why it faulted earlier.\n   Now that you've initialized env properly,\n   it should not fault.\n   If it still faults, you probably haven't mapped the\n   UENVS area user-readable (back in Part A in\n   pmap.c; this is the first time we've actually\n   used the UENVS area).\n\n\n   Exercise 8.\n      Add the required code to the user library, then \n      boot your kernel.  You should see user/hello\n      print \"hello, world\" and then print \"i\n      am environment 00001000\".\n      user/hello then attempts to \"exit\"\n      by calling sys_env_destroy()\n      (see lib/libmain.c and lib/exit.c).\n      Since the kernel currently only supports one user environment,\n      it should report that it has destroyed the only environment\n      and then drop into the kernel monitor.\n      You should be able to get make grade\n      to succeed on the hello test.\n   \n\nPage faults and memory protection\n\n   Memory protection is a crucial feature of an operating system,\n   ensuring that\n   bugs in one program cannot corrupt other programs or corrupt the operating\n   system itself.\n\n\n   Operating systems usually rely on hardware support\n   to implement memory protection. \n   The OS keeps the hardware informed about which virtual addresses\n   are valid and which are not.  When a program tries to access an invalid\n   address or one for which it has no permissions, the processor stops the\n   program at the instruction causing the fault and then traps\n   into the kernel with information about the attempted operation.\n   If the fault is fixable, the kernel can fix it and let the program \n   continue running.  If the fault is not fixable, then the program cannot\n   continue, since it will never get past the instruction causing the fault.\n\n\n   As an example of a fixable fault, consider an automatically extended stack.\n   In many systems the kernel initially allocates a single stack page, and then\n   if a program faults accessing pages further down the stack, the kernel\n   will allocate those pages automatically and let the program continue.\n   By doing this, the kernel only allocates as much stack memory as\n   the program needs, but the program can work under the illusion that it\n   has an arbitrarily large stack.\n\n\n   System calls present an interesting problem for memory protection.\n   Most system call interfaces let user programs pass pointers to the \n   kernel.  These pointers point at user buffers to be read or written.\n   The kernel then dereferences these pointers\n   while carrying out the system call.\n   There are two problems with this:\n\n\n   \n      A page fault in the kernel\n      is potentially a lot more serious than a page fault in a user program.\n      If the kernel page-faults while manipulating its own data structures,\n      that's a kernel bug, and the\n      fault handler should panic the kernel\n      (and hence the whole system).\n      But when the kernel is dereferencing pointers\n      given to it by the user program,\n      it needs a way to remember that any page faults these dereferences cause\n      are actually on behalf of the user program.\n   \n   \n      The kernel typically has more memory permissions than the user program.\n      The user program might pass a pointer to a system call that points\n      to memory that the kernel can read or write but that the program\n      cannot.\n      The kernel must be careful not to be tricked into dereferencing\n      such a pointer, since that might reveal private information or\n      destroy the integrity of the kernel.\n   \n\n\n   For both of these reasons the kernel must be extremely careful when \n   handling pointers presented by user programs.\n\n\n   You will now solve these two problems with \n   a single mechanism that scrutinizes\n   all pointers passed from userspace into the kernel.\n   When a program passes the kernel a pointer, the kernel will check\n   that the address is in the user part of the address space,\n   and that the page table would allow the memory operation.\n\n\n   Thus, the kernel will never suffer a page fault due to dereferencing\n   a user-supplied pointer.\n   If the kernel does page fault, it should panic and terminate.\n\n\n   Exercise 9.\n      Change kern/trap.c to panic if a page\n      fault happens in kernel mode.\n   \n   \n      Hint: to determine whether a fault happened in user mode or\n      in kernel mode, check the low bits of the tf_cs.\n   \n   Read user_mem_assert in kern/pmap.c\n      and implement user_mem_check in that same file.\n   \n   \n      Change kern/syscall.c to sanity check arguments\n      to system calls.\n   \n   \n      Change kern/init.c to run user/buggyhello\n      instead of user/hello.  Compile your kernel and boot it.\n      The environment should be destroyed,\n      and the kernel should not panic.\n      You should see:\n   \n   \n    [00001000] user_mem_check assertion failure for va 00000001\n    [00001000] free env 00001000\n    Destroyed the only environment - nothing more to do!\n    \n   \n\n   Note that the same mechanism you just implemented also works for \n   malicious user applications (such as user/evilhello).\n\n\n   Exercise 10.\n      Change kern/init.c to run user/evilhello.\n      Compile your kernel and boot it.\n      The environment should be destroyed,\n      and the kernel should not panic.\n      You should see:\n   \n   \n    [00000000] new env 00001000\n    [00001000] user_mem_check assertion failure for va f010000c\n    [00001000] free env 00001000\n    \n\nHand-In Procedure\nIf you submit multiple times, we will take the latest\nsubmission and count late hours accordingly.\n\n\n   You do not need to turn in answers\n   to any of the questions in the text of the lab.\n   (Do answer them for yourself though!  They will help with the rest of the lab.)\n\n\n    Create a compressed LAB3_[Team_Number].tar file containing all the files and sumbit in KLMS. Make sure that your code runs successfully in the given kcloud VMs.\n   We will be grading your solutions with a grading program.\n   You can run make grade\n   to test your solutions with the grading program.\n\n\n   This completes the lab.\n\n"},"LAB4.html":{"url":"LAB4.html","title":"Lab 4: Preemptive Multitasking","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\n\n   In this lab you will implement preemptive multitasking among multiple\n   simultaneously active user-mode environments.\n\n\n   In part A you will\n   add multiprocessor support to JOS,\n   implement round-robin scheduling, and add basic environment\n   management system calls (calls that create and destroy environments,\n   and allocate/map memory).\n\n\n   In part B, you will implement a Unix-like fork(),\n   which allows a user-mode environment to create copies of\n   itself.\n\n\n   Finally, in part C you will add support for inter-process\n   communication (IPC), allowing different user-mode environments to\n   communicate and synchronize with each other explicitly.

While all CPUs\n   are functionally identical in SMP, during the boot process they\n   can be classified into two types: the bootstrap processor (BSP) is\n   responsible for initializing the system and for booting the operating\n   system; and the application processors (APs) are activated by the BSP\n   only after the operating system is up and running. Which processor is\n   the BSP is determined by the hardware and the BIOS. Up to this point,\n   all your existing JOS code has been running on the BSP. \n\n\n   In an SMP system, each CPU has an accompanying local APIC (LAPIC) unit.\n   The LAPIC units are responsible for delivering interrupts throughout\n   the system. The LAPIC also provides its connected CPU with a unique\n   identifier. In this lab, we make use of the following basic\n   functionality of the LAPIC unit (in kern/lapic.c):\n\n\n   Reading the LAPIC identifier (APIC ID) to tell which CPU our code is\n      currently running on (see cpunum()). \n   \n   Sending the STARTUP interprocessor interrupt (IPI) from\n      the BSP to the APs to bring up other CPUs (see\n      lapic_startap()).\n   \n   In part C, we program LAPIC's built-in timer to trigger clock\n      interrupts to support preemptive multitasking (see\n      apic_init()).\n   \n\n\n   A processor accesses its LAPIC using memory-mapped I/O (MMIO).\n   In MMIO, a portion of physical memory is hardwired to the\n   registers of some I/O devices, so the same load/store instructions\n   typically used to access memory can be used to access device\n   registers.  You've already seen one IO hole at physical address\n   0xA0000 (we use this to write to the VGA display buffer).\n   The LAPIC lives in a hole starting at physical address\n   0xFE000000 (32MB short of 4GB), so it's too high for us to\n   access using our usual direct map at KERNBASE.  The JOS virtual memory\n   map leaves a 4MB gap at MMIOBASE so we have a place to map\n   devices like this.  Since later labs introduce more MMIO regions,\n   you'll write a simple function to allocate space from this region and\n   map device memory to it.\n\n\n   Exercise 1.\n      Implement mmio_map_region in kern/pmap.c.  To\n      see how this is used, look at the beginning of\n      lapic_init in kern/lapic.c.  You'll have to do\n      the next exercise, too, before the tests for\n      mmio_map_region will run.\n   \n\nApplication Processor Bootstrap\n\n   Before booting up APs, the BSP should first collect information\n   about the multiprocessor system, such as the total number of\n   CPUs, their APIC IDs and the MMIO address of the LAPIC unit.\n   The mp_init() function in kern/mpconfig.c\n   retrieves this information by reading the MP configuration\n   table that resides in the BIOS's region of memory.\n\n\n   The boot_aps() function (in kern/init.c) drives\n   the AP bootstrap process.  APs start in real mode, much like how the\n   bootloader started in boot/boot.S, so boot_aps()\n   copies the AP entry code (kern/mpentry.S) to a memory\n   location that is addressable in the real mode.  Unlike with the\n   bootloader, we have some control over where the AP will start\n   executing code; we copy the entry code to 0x7000\n   (MPENTRY_PADDR), but any unused, page-aligned\n   physical address below 640KB would work.\n\n\n   After that, boot_aps() activates APs one after another, by\n   sending STARTUP IPIs to the LAPIC unit of the corresponding\n   AP, along with an initial CS:IP address at which the AP\n   should start running its entry code (MPENTRY_PADDR in our\n   case). The entry code in kern/mpentry.S is quite similar to\n   that of boot/boot.S. After some brief setup, it puts the AP\n   into protected mode with paging enabled, and then calls the C setup\n   routine mp_main() (also in kern/init.c).\n   boot_aps() waits for the AP to signal a \n   CPU_STARTED flag in cpu_status field of\n   its struct CpuInfo before going on to wake up the next one.\n\n\n   Exercise 2.\n      Read boot_aps() and mp_main() in\n      kern/init.c, and the assembly code in\n      kern/mpentry.S.  Make sure you understand the control flow\n      transfer during the bootstrap of APs. Then modify your implementation\n      of page_init() in kern/pmap.c to avoid adding\n      the page at MPENTRY_PADDR to the free list, so that we\n      can safely copy and run AP bootstrap code at that physical address.\n      Your code should pass the updated check_page_free_list()\n      test (but might fail the updated check_kern_pgdir()\n      test, which we will fix soon).\n   \n\n\n   Question\n   \n      \n         Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with\n         boot/boot.S.  Bearing in mind that kern/mpentry.S\n         is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like\n         everything else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro\n         MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it\n         necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in\n         boot/boot.S? In other words, what could go wrong if it\n         were omitted in kern/mpentry.S?\n         \n         Hint: recall the differences between the link address and the \n         load address that we have discussed in Lab 1.\n      \n   \n\nPer-CPU State and Initialization\n\n   When writing a multiprocessor OS, it is important to distinguish\n   between per-CPU state that is private to each processor, and global\n   state that the whole system shares.  kern/cpu.h defines most\n   of the per-CPU state, including struct CpuInfo, which stores\n   per-CPU variables.  cpunum() always returns the ID of the\n   CPU that calls it, which can be used as an index into arrays like\n   cpus.  Alternatively, the macro thiscpu is\n   shorthand for the current CPU's struct CpuInfo.\n\n\n   Here is the per-CPU state you should be aware of:\n\n\n   \n      \n         Per-CPU kernel stack.\n         \n         Because multiple CPUs can trap into the kernel simultaneously,\n         we need a separate kernel stack for each processor to prevent them from\n         interfering with each other's execution. The array\n         percpu_kstacks[NCPU][KSTKSIZE] reserves space for NCPU's\n         worth of kernel stacks.\n      \n      \n         In Lab 2, you mapped the physical memory that bootstack\n         refers to as the BSP's kernel stack just below\n         KSTACKTOP.\n         Similarly, in this lab, you will map each CPU's kernel stack into this\n         region with guard pages acting as a buffer between them.  CPU 0's\n         stack will still grow down from KSTACKTOP; CPU 1's stack\n         will start KSTKGAP bytes below the bottom of CPU 0's\n         stack, and so on. inc/memlayout.h shows the mapping layout.\n      \n   \n   \n      \n         Per-CPU TSS and TSS descriptor.\n         \n         A per-CPU task state segment (TSS) is also needed in order to specify\n         where each CPU's kernel stack lives. The TSS for CPU i is stored\n         in cpus[i].cpu_ts, and the corresponding TSS descriptor is\n         defined in the GDT entry gdt[(GD_TSS0 >> 3) + i]. The\n         global ts variable defined in kern/trap.c will\n         no longer be useful.\n      \n   \n   \n      \n         Per-CPU current environment pointer.\n         \n         Since each CPU can run different user process simultaneously, we\n         redefined the symbol curenv to refer to\n         cpus[cpunum()].cpu_env (or thiscpu->cpu_env), which\n         points to the environment currently executing on the\n         current CPU (the CPU on which the code is running).\n      \n   \n   \n      \n         Per-CPU system registers.\n         \n         All registers, including system registers, are private to a\n         CPU. Therefore, instructions that\n         initialize these registers, such as lcr3(),\n         ltr(), lgdt(), lidt(), etc., must\n         be executed once on each CPU. Functions env_init_percpu()\n         and trap_init_percpu() are defined for this purpose.\n      \n   \n   \n      In addition to this, if you have added any extra per-CPU state or performed\n      any additional CPU-specific initialization (by say, setting new bits in\n      the CPU registers) in your solutions to challenge problems in earlier labs,\n      be sure to replicate them on each CPU here!\n   \n\n\n\n   Exercise 3.\n      Modify mem_init_mp() (in kern/pmap.c) to map\n      per-CPU stacks starting\n      at KSTACKTOP, as shown in\n      inc/memlayout.h.  The size of each stack is\n      KSTKSIZE bytes plus KSTKGAP bytes of\n      unmapped guard pages. Your code should pass the new check in\n      check_kern_pgdir().\n   \n\n\n   Exercise 4.\n      The code in trap_init_percpu() (kern/trap.c)\n      initializes the TSS and\n      TSS descriptor for the BSP. It worked in Lab 3, but is incorrect\n      when running on other CPUs. Change the code so that it can work\n      on all CPUs. (Note: your new code should not use the global\n      ts variable any more.)\n   \n\n\n   When you finish the above exercises, run JOS in QEMU with 4 CPUs using\n   make qemu CPUS=4 (or make qemu-nox CPUS=4), you\n   should see output like this:\n\n\n...\nPhysical memory: 66556K available, base = 640K, extended = 65532K\ncheck_page_alloc() succeeded!\ncheck_page() succeeded!\ncheck_kern_pgdir() succeeded!\ncheck_page_installed_pgdir() succeeded!\nSMP: CPU 0 found 4 CPU(s)\nenabled interrupts: 1 2\nSMP: CPU 1 starting\nSMP: CPU 2 starting\nSMP: CPU 3 starting\n\nLocking\n\n   Our current code spins after initializing the AP in\n   mp_main(). Before letting the AP get any further, we need\n   to first address race conditions when multiple CPUs run kernel code\n   simultaneously.  The simplest way to achieve this is to use a big\n   kernel lock.\n   The big kernel lock is a single global lock that is held whenever an\n   environment enters kernel mode, and is released when the environment\n   returns to user mode. In this model, environments in user mode can run\n   concurrently on any available CPUs, but no more than one environment can\n   run in kernel mode; any other environments that try to enter kernel mode\n   are forced to wait.\n\n\n   kern/spinlock.h declares the big kernel lock, namely\n   kernel_lock. It also provides lock_kernel()\n   and unlock_kernel(), shortcuts to acquire and\n   release the lock. You should apply the big kernel lock at four locations:\n\n\n   \n      In i386_init(), acquire the lock before the BSP wakes up the\n      other CPUs. \n   \n   \n      In mp_main(), acquire the lock after initializing the AP,\n      and then call sched_yield() to start running environments\n      on this AP.\n   \n   \n      In trap(), acquire the lock when trapped from user mode.\n      To determine whether a trap happened in user mode or in kernel mode,\n      check the low bits of the tf_cs.\n   \n   \n      In env_run(), release the lock right before\n      switching to user mode. Do not do that too early or too late, otherwise\n      you will experience races or deadlocks.\n   \n\n\n   Exercise 5.\n      Apply the big kernel lock as described above, by calling\n      lock_kernel() and unlock_kernel() at\n      the proper locations.\n   \n\n\n   How to test if your locking is correct? You can't at this moment! But you\n   will be able to after you implement the scheduler in the\n   next exercise.\n\n\n   Question\n   \n      \n         It seems that using the big kernel lock guarantees that only one CPU\n         can run the kernel code at a time. \n         Why do we still need separate kernel stacks for each CPU?\n         Describe a scenario in which using a shared kernel stack will go\n         wrong, even with the protection of the big kernel lock.\n      \n   \n\n\n   Challenge!\n      The big kernel lock is simple and easy to use. Nevertheless, it\n      eliminates all concurrency in kernel mode. Most\n      modern operating systems use different locks to protect different\n      parts of their shared state, an\n      approach called fine-grained locking.\n      Fine-grained locking can increase performance significantly, but is\n      more difficult to implement and error-prone. If you are brave\n      enough, drop the big kernel lock and embrace concurrency in JOS!\n   \n   \n      It is up to you to decide the locking granularity (the amount of\n      data that a lock protects). As a hint, you may consider using\n      spin locks to ensure exclusive access to these shared components\n      in the JOS kernel:\n   \n   \n      The page allocator.\n      The console driver.\n      The scheduler.\n      The inter-process communication (IPC) state that you will\n         implement in the part C.\n      \n   \n-->\nRound-Robin Scheduling\n\n   Your next task in this lab is to change the JOS kernel\n   so that it can alternate between multiple environments\n   in \"round-robin\" fashion.\n   Round-robin scheduling in JOS works as follows:\n\n\n       The function sched_yield() in the new kern/sched.c\n      is responsible for selecting a new environment to run.\n      It searches sequentially through the envs[] array\n      in circular fashion,\n      starting just after the previously running environment\n      (or at the beginning of the array\n      if there was no previously running environment),\n      picks the first environment it finds\n      with a status of ENV_RUNNABLE\n      (see inc/env.h),\n      and calls env_run() to jump into that environment. \n   \n       sched_yield() must never run the same environment\n      on two CPUs at the same time.  It can tell that an environment\n      is currently running on some CPU (possibly the current CPU)\n      because that environment's status will be ENV_RUNNING.\n   \n       We have implemented a new system call for you,\n      sys_yield(),\n      which user environments can call\n      to invoke the kernel's sched_yield() function\n      and thereby voluntarily give up the CPU to a different environment.  \n   \n\n\n   Exercise 6.\n      Implement round-robin scheduling in sched_yield()\n      as described above.  Don't forget to modify\n      syscall() to dispatch sys_yield().\n   \n   Make sure to invoke sched_yield() in mp_main.\n    Modify kern/init.c to create three (or more!) environments\n      that all run the program user/yield.c.\n   \n   Run make qemu.\n      You should see the environments\n      switch back and forth between each other\n      five times before terminating, like below.\n   \n   Test also with several CPUS: make qemu CPUS=2.\n   \n...\nHello, I am environment 00001000.\nHello, I am environment 00001001.\nHello, I am environment 00001002.\nBack in environment 00001000, iteration 0.\nBack in environment 00001001, iteration 0.\nBack in environment 00001002, iteration 0.\nBack in environment 00001000, iteration 1.\nBack in environment 00001001, iteration 1.\nBack in environment 00001002, iteration 1.\n...\n\n   \n      After the yield programs exit, there will be no runnable\n      environment in the system, the scheduler should\n      invoke the JOS kernel monitor.\n      If any of this does not happen,\n      then fix your code before proceeding.\n   \n   \n      If you use CPUS=1 at this point, all environments should\n      successfully run. Setting CPUS larger than 1 at this time may result in\n      a general protection fault, kernel page fault, or other unexpected\n      interrupt once there are no more runnable environments due to unhandled\n      timer interrupts (which we will fix below!).\n      -->\n\n\n   Question\n   \n      \n         In your implementation of env_run() you should have\n         called lcr3().  Before and after the call to\n         lcr3(), your code makes references (at least it should)\n         to the variable e, the argument to env_run.\n         Upon loading the %cr3 register, the addressing context\n         used by the MMU is instantly changed.  But a virtual\n         address (namely e) has meaning relative to a given\n         address context--the address context specifies the physical address to\n         which the virtual address maps.  Why can the pointer e be\n         dereferenced both before and after the addressing switch?\n      \n      \n         Whenever the kernel switches from one environment to another,\n         it must ensure the old environment's registers are saved\n         so they can be restored properly later. \n         Why?  Where does this happen?\n      \n   \n\n\n   Challenge!\n      Add a less trivial scheduling policy to the kernel,\n      such as a fixed-priority scheduler that allows each environment\n      to be assigned a priority\n      and ensures that higher-priority environments\n      are always chosen in preference to lower-priority environments.\n      If you're feeling really adventurous,\n      try implementing a Unix-style adjustable-priority scheduler\n      or even a lottery or stride scheduler.\n      (Look up \"lottery scheduling\" and \"stride scheduling\" in Google.)\n   \n   \n      Write a test program or two\n      that verifies that your scheduling algorithm is working correctly\n      (i.e., the right environments get run in the right order).\n      It may be easier to write these test programs\n      once you have implemented fork() and IPC\n      in parts B and C of this lab.\n   \n\n\n   Challenge!\n      The JOS kernel currently does not allow applications\n      to use the x86 processor's x87 floating-point unit (FPU),\n      MMX instructions, or Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE).\n      Extend the Env structure\n      to provide a save area for the processor's floating point state,\n      and extend the context switching code\n      to save and restore this state properly\n      when switching from one environment to another.\n      The FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions may be useful,\n      but note that these are not in the old i386 user's manual\n      because they were introduced in more recent processors.\n      Write a user-level test program\n      that does something cool with floating-point.\n   \n-->\nSystem Calls for Environment Creation\n\n   Although your kernel is now capable of running and switching between\n   multiple user-level environments,\n   it is still limited to running environments\n   that the kernel initially set up.\n   You will now implement the necessary JOS system calls\n   to allow user environments to create and start\n   other new user environments.\n\n\n   Unix provides the fork() system call\n   as its process creation primitive.\n   Unix fork() copies\n   the entire address space of calling process (the parent)\n   to create a new process (the child).\n   The only differences between the two observable from user space\n   are their process IDs and parent process IDs\n   (as returned by getpid and getppid).\n   In the parent,\n   fork() returns the child's process ID,\n   while in the child, fork() returns 0.\n   By default, each process gets its own private address space, and\n   neither process's modifications to memory are visible to the other.\n\n\n   You will provide a different, more primitive\n   set of JOS system calls\n   for creating new user-mode environments.\n   With these system calls you will be able to implement\n   a Unix-like fork() entirely in user space,\n   in addition to other styles of environment creation.\n   The new system calls you will write for JOS are as follows:\n\n\n       sys_exofork:\n       This system call creates a new environment with an almost blank slate:\n      nothing is mapped in the user portion of its address space,\n      and it is not runnable.\n      The new environment will have the same register state as the\n      parent environment at the time of the sys_exofork call.\n      In the parent, sys_exofork\n      will return the envid_t of the newly created\n      environment\n      (or a negative error code if the environment allocation failed).\n      In the child, however, it will return 0.\n      (Since the child starts out marked as not runnable,\n      sys_exofork will not actually return in the child\n      until the parent has explicitly allowed this\n      by marking the child runnable using....)\n   \n       sys_env_set_status:\n       Sets the status of a specified environment\n      to ENV_RUNNABLE or ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE.\n      This system call is typically used\n      to mark a new environment ready to run,\n      once its address space and register state\n      has been fully initialized.\n   \n       sys_page_alloc:\n       Allocates a page of physical memory\n      and maps it at a given virtual address\n      in a given environment's address space.\n   \n       sys_page_map:\n       Copy a page mapping (not the contents of a page!)\n      from one environment's address space to another,\n      leaving a memory sharing arrangement in place\n      so that the new and the old mappings both refer to\n      the same page of physical memory.\n   \n       sys_page_unmap:\n       Unmap a page mapped at a given virtual address\n      in a given environment.\n   \n\n\n   For all of the system calls above that accept environment IDs,\n   the JOS kernel supports the convention\n   that a value of 0 means \"the current environment.\"\n   This convention is implemented by envid2env()\n   in kern/env.c.\n\n\n   We have provided a very primitive implementation\n   of a Unix-like fork()\n   in the test program user/dumbfork.c.\n   This test program uses the above system calls\n   to create and run a child environment\n   with a copy of its own address space.\n   The two environments\n   then switch back and forth using sys_yield\n   as in the previous exercise.\n   The parent exits after 10 iterations,\n   whereas the child exits after 20.\n\n\n   Exercise 7.\n      Implement the system calls described above\n      in kern/syscall.c and make sure syscall() calls\n      them.\n      You will need to use various functions\n      in kern/pmap.c and kern/env.c,\n      particularly envid2env().\n      For now, whenever you call envid2env(),\n      pass 1 in the checkperm parameter.\n      Be sure you check for any invalid system call arguments,\n      returning -E_INVAL in that case.\n      Test your JOS kernel with user/dumbfork\n      and make sure it works before proceeding.\n   \n\n\n   Challenge!\n      Add the additional system calls necessary\n      to read all of the vital state of an existing environment\n      as well as set it up.\n      Then implement a user mode program that forks off a child environment,\n      runs it for a while (e.g., a few iterations of sys_yield()),\n      then takes a complete snapshot or checkpoint\n      of the child environment,\n      runs the child for a while longer,\n      and finally restores the child environment to the state it was in\n      at the checkpoint\n      and continues it from there.\n      Thus, you are effectively \"replaying\"\n      the execution of the child environment from an intermediate state.\n      Make the child environment perform some interaction with the user\n      using sys_cgetc() or readline()\n      so that the user can view and mutate its internal state,\n      and verify that with your checkpoint/restart\n      you can give the child environment a case of selective amnesia,\n      making it \"forget\" everything that happened beyond a certain point.\n   \n-->\n\n   This completes Part A of the lab;\n   make sure it passes all of the Part A tests when you run\n   make grade, and hand it in using make\n   handin as usual.  If you are trying to figure out why a particular\n   test case is failing, run ./grade-lab4 -v, which will\n   show you the output of the kernel builds and QEMU runs for each\n   test, until a test fails.  When a test fails, the script will stop,\n   and then you can inspect jos.out to see what the\n   kernel actually printed.\n\nPart B: Copy-on-Write Fork\n\n   As mentioned earlier,\n   Unix provides the fork() system call\n   as its primary process creation primitive.\n   The fork() system call\n   copies the address space of the calling process (the parent)\n   to create a new process (the child).\n\n\n   xv6 Unix implements fork() by copying all data from the\n   parent's pages into new pages allocated for the child.\n   This is essentially the same approach\n   that dumbfork() takes.\n   The copying of the parent's address space into the child is\n   the most expensive part of the fork() operation.\n\n\n   However, a call to fork()\n   is frequently followed almost immediately\n   by a call to exec() in the child process,\n   which replaces the child's memory with a new program.\n   This is what the the shell typically does, for example.\n   In this case,\n   the time spent copying the parent's address space is largely wasted,\n   because the child process will use\n   very little of its memory before calling exec().\n\n\n   For this reason,\n   later versions of Unix took advantage\n   of virtual memory hardware\n   to allow the parent and child to share\n   the memory mapped into their respective address spaces\n   until one of the processes actually modifies it.  \n   This technique is known as copy-on-write.\n   To do this,\n   on fork() the kernel would\n   copy the address space mappings\n   from the parent to the child\n   instead of the contents of the mapped pages,\n   and at the same time mark the now-shared pages read-only.\n   When one of the two processes tries to write to one of these shared pages,\n   the process takes a page fault.\n   At this point, the Unix kernel realizes that the page\n   was really a \"virtual\" or \"copy-on-write\" copy,\n   and so it makes a new, private, writable copy of the page for the\n   faulting process.\n   In this way, the contents of individual pages aren't actually copied\n   until they are actually written to.\n   This optimization makes a fork() followed by\n   an exec() in the child much cheaper:\n   the child will probably only need to copy one page\n   (the current page of its stack)\n   before it calls exec().\n\n\n   In the next piece of this lab, you will implement a \"proper\"\n   Unix-like fork() with copy-on-write,\n   as a user space library routine.\n   Implementing fork() and copy-on-write support in user space\n   has the benefit that the kernel remains much simpler\n   and thus more likely to be correct.\n   It also lets individual user-mode programs\n   define their own semantics for fork().\n   A program that wants a slightly different implementation\n   (for example, the expensive always-copy version like dumbfork(),\n   or one in which the parent and child actually share memory afterward)\n   can easily provide its own.\n\nUser-level page fault handling\n\n   A user-level copy-on-write fork() needs to know about\n   page faults on write-protected pages, so that's what you'll\n   implement first.\n   Copy-on-write is only one of many possible uses\n   for user-level page fault handling.\n\n\n   It's common to set up an address space so that page faults\n   indicate when some action needs to take place.\n   For example,\n   most Unix kernels initially map only a single page\n   in a new process's stack region,\n   and allocate and map additional stack pages later \"on demand\"\n   as the process's stack consumption increases\n   and causes page faults on stack addresses that are not yet mapped.\n   A typical Unix kernel must keep track of what action to take\n   when a page fault occurs in each region of a process's space.\n   For example,\n   a fault in the stack region will typically\n   allocate and map new page of physical memory.\n   A fault in the program's BSS region will typically\n   allocate  a new page, fill it with zeroes, and map it.\n   In systems with demand-paged executables,\n   a fault in the text region will read the corresponding page\n   of the binary off of disk and then map it.\n\n\n   This is a lot of information for the kernel to keep track of.\n   Instead of taking the traditional Unix approach,\n   you will decide what to do about each page fault in user space,\n   where bugs are less damaging.\n   This design has the added benefit of allowing \n   programs great flexibility in defining their memory regions;\n   you'll use user-level page fault handling later\n   for mapping and accessing files on a disk-based file system.\n\nSetting the Page Fault Handler\n\n   In order to handle its own page faults,\n   a user environment will need to register\n   a page fault handler entrypoint with the JOS kernel.\n   The user environment registers its page fault entrypoint\n   via the new sys_env_set_pgfault_upcall system call.\n   We have added a new member to the Env structure,\n   env_pgfault_upcall,\n   to record this information.\n\n\n   Exercise 8.\n      Implement the sys_env_set_pgfault_upcall system call.\n      Be sure to enable permission checking\n      when looking up the environment ID of the target environment,\n      since this is a \"dangerous\" system call.\n   \n\nNormal and Exception Stacks in User Environments\n\n   During normal execution,\n   a user environment in JOS\n   will run on the normal user stack:\n   its ESP register starts out pointing at USTACKTOP,\n   and the stack data it pushes resides on the page\n   between USTACKTOP-PGSIZE and USTACKTOP-1 inclusive.\n   When a page fault occurs in user mode,\n   however,\n   the kernel will restart the user environment\n   running a designated user-level page fault handler\n   on a different stack,\n   namely the user exception stack.\n   In essence, we will make the JOS kernel\n   implement automatic \"stack switching\"\n   on behalf of the user environment,\n   in much the same way that the x86 processor\n   already implements stack switching on behalf of JOS\n   when transferring from user mode to kernel mode!\n\n\n   The JOS user exception stack is also one page in size,\n   and its top is defined to be at virtual address UXSTACKTOP,\n   so the valid bytes of the user exception stack\n   are from UXSTACKTOP-PGSIZE through UXSTACKTOP-1 inclusive.\n   While running on this exception stack,\n   the user-level page fault handler\n   can use JOS's regular system calls to map new pages or adjust mappings\n   so as to fix whatever problem originally caused the page fault.\n   Then the user-level page fault handler returns,\n   via an assembly language stub,\n   to the faulting code on the original stack. \n\n\n   Each user environment that wants to support user-level page fault handling\n   will need to allocate memory for its own exception stack,\n   using the sys_page_alloc() system call introduced in part A.\n\nInvoking the User Page Fault Handler\n\n   You will now need to\n   change the page fault handling code in kern/trap.c\n   to handle page faults from user mode as follows.\n   We will call the state of the user environment at the time of the \n   fault the trap-time state.  \n\n\n   If there is no page fault handler registered,\n   the JOS kernel destroys the user environment with a message as before.\n   Otherwise,\n   the kernel sets up a trap frame on the exception stack that looks like\n   a struct UTrapframe from inc/trap.h:\n\n\n                    \n\n   The kernel then arranges for the user environment to resume execution\n   with the page fault handler\n   running on the exception stack with this stack frame;\n   you must figure out how to make this happen.\n   The fault_va is the virtual address\n   that caused the page fault.\n\n\n   If the user environment is already running on the user exception stack\n   when an exception occurs,\n   then the page fault handler itself has faulted.\n   In this case,\n   you should start the new stack frame just under the current\n   tf->tf_esp rather than at UXSTACKTOP.\n   You should first push an empty 32-bit word, then a struct UTrapframe.\n\n\n   To test whether tf->tf_esp is already on the user\n   exception stack, check whether it is in the range\n   between UXSTACKTOP-PGSIZE and UXSTACKTOP-1, inclusive.\n\n\n   Exercise 9.\n      Implement the code in page_fault_handler in\n      kern/trap.c\n      required to dispatch page faults to the user-mode handler.\n      Be sure to take appropriate precautions\n      when writing into the exception stack.\n      (What happens if the user environment runs out of space\n      on the exception stack?)\n   \n\nUser-mode Page Fault Entrypoint\n\n   Next, you need to implement the assembly routine that will\n   take care of calling the C page fault handler and resume\n   execution at the original faulting instruction.\n   This assembly routine is the handler that will be registered\n   with the kernel using sys_env_set_pgfault_upcall().\n\n\n   Exercise 10.\n      Implement the _pgfault_upcall routine\n      in lib/pfentry.S.\n      The interesting part is returning to the original point in\n      the user code that caused the page fault.\n      You'll return directly there, without going back through\n      the kernel.\n      The hard part is simultaneously switching stacks and\n      re-loading the EIP.\n   \n\n\n   Finally, you need to implement the C user library side\n   of the user-level page fault handling mechanism.\n\n\n   Exercise 11.\n      Finish set_pgfault_handler()\n      in lib/pgfault.c.\n   \n\nTesting\n\n   Run user/faultread (make run-faultread).  You should see:\n\n\n...\n[00000000] new env 00001000\n[00001000] user fault va 00000000 ip 0080003a\nTRAP frame ...\n[00001000] free env 00001000\n\n\n   Run user/faultdie.

[ Note: The ordering here (i.e., marking a page\n      as COW in the child before marking it in the parent) actually matters!\n      Can you see why? Try to think of a specific case where reversing the\n      order could cause trouble. ] duppage sets both PTEs so that\n      the page is not writeable, and to contain PTE_COW in the\n      \"avail\" field to distinguish copy-on-write pages from genuine\n      read-only pages.\n      \n         The exception stack is not remapped this way, however.\n         Instead you need to allocate a fresh page in the child for\n         the exception stack.  Since the page fault handler will be \n         doing the actual copying and the page fault handler runs\n         on the exception stack, the exception stack cannot be made\n         copy-on-write: who would copy it?\n      \n      fork() also needs to handle pages that are\n         present, but not writable or copy-on-write.\n      \n   \n       The parent sets the user page fault entrypoint for the child\n      to look like its own.\n   \n       The child is now ready to run, so the parent marks it runnable.\n\n\n   Each time one of the environments writes a copy-on-write page that it\n   hasn't yet written, it will take a page fault.\n   Here's the control flow for the user page fault handler:\n\n\n       The kernel propagates the page fault to _pgfault_upcall,\n      which calls fork()'s pgfault() handler.\n   \n       pgfault() checks that the fault is a write\n      (check for FEC_WR in the error code) and that the\n      PTE for the page is marked PTE_COW.\n      If not, panic.\n   \n       pgfault() allocates a new page mapped\n      at a temporary location and copies\n      the contents of the faulting page into it.\n      Then the fault handler maps the new page at the\n      appropriate address with read/write permissions,\n      in place of the old read-only mapping.\n   \n\nThe user-level lib/fork.c code must consult the environment's page\n   tables for several of the operations above (e.g., that the PTE for a page is\n   marked PTE_COW).  The kernel maps the environment's page tables at\n   UVPT exactly for this purpose.  It uses a clever mapping trick to make it to make it easy to lookup\n   PTEs for user code. lib/entry.S sets up uvpt and\n   uvpd so that you can easily lookup page-table information in\n   lib/fork.c.\n\n   Exercise 12.\n      Implement fork, duppage and\n      pgfault in lib/fork.c.\n   \n   \n      Test your code with the forktree program.\n      It should produce the following messages,\n      with interspersed 'new env', 'free env',\n      and 'exiting gracefully' messages.\n      The messages may not appear in this order, and the\n      environment IDs may be different.\n   \n   \n    1000: I am ''\n    1001: I am '0'\n    2000: I am '00'\n    2001: I am '000'\n    1002: I am '1'\n    3000: I am '11'\n    3001: I am '10'\n    4000: I am '100'\n    1003: I am '01'\n    5000: I am '010'\n    4001: I am '011'\n    2002: I am '110'\n    1004: I am '001'\n    1005: I am '111'\n    1006: I am '101'\n    \n\n\n   Challenge!\n      Implement a shared-memory fork()\n      called sfork().  This version should have the parent\n      and child share all their memory pages\n      (so writes in one environment appear in the other)\n      except for pages in the stack area,\n      which should be treated in the usual copy-on-write manner.\n      Modify user/forktree.c\n      to use sfork() instead of regular fork().\n      Also, once you have finished implementing IPC in part C,\n      use your sfork() to run user/pingpongs.\n      You will have to find a new way to provide the functionality\n      of the global thisenv pointer.\n   \n\n\n   Challenge!\n      Your implementation of fork \n      makes a huge number of system calls.  On the x86, switching into\n      the kernel using interrupts has non-trivial cost.  Augment the\n      system call interface\n      so that it is possible to send a batch of system calls at once.\n      Then change fork to use this interface.\n   \n   How much faster is your new fork?\n   You can answer this (roughly) by using analytical\n      arguments to estimate how much of an improvement batching\n      system calls will make to the performance of your\n      fork: How expensive is an int 0x30\n      instruction? How many times do you execute int 0x30\n      in your fork? Is accessing the TSS stack\n      switch also expensive? And so on...\n   \n   Alternatively, you can boot your kernel on real hardware\n      and really benchmark your code. See the RDTSC\n      (read time-stamp counter) instruction, defined in the IA32\n      manual, which counts the number of clock cycles that have\n      elapsed since the last processor reset. QEMU doesn't emulate\n      this instruction faithfully (it can either count the number of\n      virtual instructions executed or use the host TSC, neither of\n      which reflects the number of cycles a real CPU would\n      require).\n   \n-->\n\n   This ends part B.  Make sure you pass all of the Part B tests when you run\n   make grade.\n\nPart C: Preemptive Multitasking and Inter-Process communication (IPC)\n\n   In the final part of lab 4\n   you will modify the kernel to preempt uncooperative environments\n   and to allow environments to pass messages to each other explicitly.\n\nClock Interrupts and Preemption\n\n   Run the user/spin test program.\n   This test program forks off a child environment,\n   which simply spins forever in a tight loop\n   once it receives control of the CPU.\n   Neither the parent environment nor the kernel ever regains the CPU.\n   This is obviously not an ideal situation\n   in terms of protecting the system from bugs or malicious code\n   in user-mode environments,\n   because any user-mode environment can bring the whole system to a halt\n   simply by getting into an infinite loop and never giving back the CPU.\n   In order to allow the kernel to preempt a running environment,\n   forcefully retaking control of the CPU from it,\n   we must extend the JOS kernel to support external hardware interrupts\n   from the clock hardware.\n\nInterrupt discipline\n\n   External interrupts (i.e., device interrupts) are referred to as IRQs.\n   There are 16 possible IRQs, numbered 0 through 15.\n   The mapping from IRQ number to IDT entry is not fixed.\n   pic_init in picirq.c maps IRQs 0-15\n   to IDT entries IRQ_OFFSET through IRQ_OFFSET+15.\n\n\n   In inc/trap.h,\n   IRQ_OFFSET is defined to be decimal 32.\n   Thus the IDT entries 32-47 correspond to the IRQs 0-15.\n   For example, the clock interrupt is IRQ 0.\n   Thus, IDT[IRQ_OFFSET+0] (i.e., IDT[32]) contains the address of\n   the clock's interrupt handler routine in the kernel.\n   This IRQ_OFFSET is chosen so that the device interrupts\n   do not overlap with the processor exceptions,\n   which could obviously cause confusion.\n   (In fact, in the early days of PCs running MS-DOS,\n   the IRQ_OFFSET effectively was zero,\n   which indeed caused massive confusion between handling hardware interrupts\n   and handling processor exceptions!)\n\n\n   In JOS, we make a key simplification compared to xv6 Unix.\n   External device interrupts are always disabled\n   when in the kernel (and, like xv6, enabled when in user space).\n   External interrupts are controlled by the FL_IF flag bit\n   of the %eflags register\n   (see inc/mmu.h).\n   When this bit is set, external interrupts are enabled.\n   While the bit can be modified in several ways,\n   because of our simplification, we will handle it solely\n   through the process of saving and restoring %eflags register\n   as we enter and leave user mode.\n\n\n   You will have to ensure that the FL_IF flag is set in\n   user environments when they run so that when an interrupt arrives, it\n   gets passed through to the processor and handled by your interrupt code.\n   Otherwise, interrupts are masked,\n   or ignored until interrupts are re-enabled.\n   We masked interrupts with the very first instruction of the bootloader,\n   and so far we have never gotten around to re-enabling them.\n\n\n   Exercise 13.\n      Modify kern/trapentry.S and kern/trap.c to\n      initialize the appropriate entries in the IDT and provide\n      handlers for IRQs 0 through 15.  Then modify the code\n      in env_alloc() in kern/env.c to ensure\n      that user environments are always run with interrupts enabled.\n   \n   \n      Also uncomment the sti instruction in sched_halt() so\n      that idle CPUs unmask interrupts.\n   \n   \n      The processor never pushes an error code\n      when invoking a hardware interrupt handler.\n      You might want to re-read section 9.2 of the\n      \n      80386 Reference Manual,\n      or section 5.8 of the\n      \n      IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3,\n      at this time.\n   \n   \n      After doing this exercise,\n      if you run your kernel with any test program\n      that runs for a non-trivial length of time\n      (e.g., spin),\n      you should see the kernel print trap frames for hardware\n      interrupts.  While interrupts are now enabled in the\n      processor, JOS isn't yet handling them, so you should see it\n      misattribute each interrupt to the currently running user\n      environment and destroy it.  Eventually it should run out of\n      environments to destroy and drop into the monitor.\n   \n\nHandling Clock Interrupts\n\n   In the user/spin program,\n   after the child environment was first run,\n   it just spun in a loop,\n   and the kernel never got control back.\n   We need to program the hardware to generate clock interrupts periodically,\n   which will force control back to the kernel\n   where we can switch control to a different user environment.\n\n\n   The calls to lapic_init and pic_init\n   (from i386_init in init.c),\n   which we have written for you,\n   set up the clock and the interrupt controller to generate interrupts.\n   You now need to write the code to handle these interrupts.\n\n\n   Exercise 14.\n      Modify the kernel's trap_dispatch() function\n      so that it calls sched_yield()\n      to find and run a different environment\n      whenever a clock interrupt takes place.\n   \n   \n      You should now be able to get the user/spin test to work:\n      the parent environment should fork off the child,\n      sys_yield() to it a couple times\n      but in each case regain control of the CPU after one time slice,\n      and finally kill the child environment and terminate gracefully.\n   \n\n\n   This is a great time to do some regression testing.  Make sure that you\n   haven't broken any earlier part of that lab that used to work (e.g.\n   forktree) by enabling interrupts.  Also, try running with\n   multiple CPUs using make CPUS=2 target.  You should\n   also be able to\n   pass stresssched now.  Run make grade to see\n   for sure. You should now get a total score of 65/80 points on this lab.\n\nInter-Process communication (IPC)\n\n   (Technically in JOS this is \"inter-environment communication\" or \"IEC\",\n   but everyone else calls it IPC, so we'll use the standard\n   term.)\n\n\n   We've been focusing on the isolation aspects of the operating\n   system, the ways it provides the illusion that each program\n   has a machine all to itself.  Another important service of\n   an operating system is to allow programs to communicate\n   with each other when they want to.  It can be quite powerful\n   to let programs interact with other programs.  The Unix\n   pipe model is the canonical example.\n\n\n   There are many models for interprocess communication. Even\n   today there are still debates about which models are best.\n   We won't get into that debate.\n   Instead, we'll implement a simple IPC mechanism and then try it out.\n\nIPC in JOS\n\n   You will implement a few additional JOS kernel system calls\n   that collectively provide a simple interprocess communication mechanism.\n   You will implement two\n   system calls, sys_ipc_recv and\n   sys_ipc_try_send.\n   Then you will implement two library wrappers\n   ipc_recv and ipc_send.\n\n\n   The \"messages\" that user environments can send to each other\n   using JOS's IPC mechanism\n   consist of two components:\n   a single 32-bit value,\n   and optionally a single page mapping.\n   Allowing environments to pass page mappings in messages\n   provides an efficient way to transfer more data\n   than will fit into a single 32-bit integer,\n   and also allows environments to set up shared memory arrangements easily.\n\nSending and Receiving Messages\n\n   To receive a message, an environment calls\n   sys_ipc_recv.\n   This system call de-schedules the current\n   environment and does not run it again until a message has\n   been received.\n   When an environment is waiting to receive a message,\n   any other environment can send it a message -\n   not just a particular environment,\n   and not just environments that have a parent/child arrangement\n   with the receiving environment.\n   In other words, the permission checking that you implemented in Part A\n   will not apply to IPC,\n   because the IPC system calls are carefully designed so as to be \"safe\":\n   an environment cannot cause another environment to malfunction\n   simply by sending it messages\n   (unless the target environment is also buggy).\n\n\n   To try to send a value, an environment calls\n   sys_ipc_try_send with both the receiver's\n   environment id and the value to be sent.  If the named\n   environment is actually receiving (it has called\n   sys_ipc_recv and not gotten a value yet),\n   then the send delivers the message and returns 0.  Otherwise\n   the send returns -E_IPC_NOT_RECV to indicate\n   that the target environment is not currently expecting\n   to receive a value.\n\n\n   A library function ipc_recv in user space will take care\n   of calling sys_ipc_recv and then looking up\n   the information about the received values in the current\n   environment's struct Env.\n\n\n   Similarly, a library function ipc_send will\n   take care of repeatedly calling sys_ipc_try_send\n   until the send succeeds.\n\nTransferring Pages\n\n   When an environment calls sys_ipc_recv\n   with a valid dstva parameter (below UTOP),\n   the environment is stating that it is willing to receive a page mapping.\n   If the sender sends a page,\n   then that page should be mapped at dstva\n   in the receiver's address space.\n   If the receiver already had a page mapped at dstva,\n   then that previous page is unmapped.\n\n\n   When an environment calls sys_ipc_try_send\n   with a valid srcva (below UTOP),\n   it means the sender wants to send the page\n   currently mapped at srcva to the receiver,\n   with permissions perm.\n   After a successful IPC,\n   the sender keeps its original mapping\n   for the page at srcva in its address space,\n   but the receiver also obtains a mapping for this same physical page\n   at the dstva originally specified by the receiver,\n   in the receiver's address space.\n   As a result this page becomes shared between the sender and receiver.\n\n\n   If either the sender or the receiver does not indicate\n   that a page should be transferred,\n   then no page is transferred.\n   After any IPC\n   the kernel sets the new field env_ipc_perm\n   in the receiver's Env structure\n   to the permissions of the page received,\n   or zero if no page was received.\n\nImplementing IPC\n\n   Exercise 15.\n      Implement sys_ipc_recv and\n      sys_ipc_try_send in kern/syscall.c.\n      Read the comments on both before implementing them, since they\n      have to work together.\n      When you call envid2env in these routines, you should\n      set the checkperm flag to 0,\n      meaning that any environment is allowed to send\n      IPC messages to any other environment,\n      and the kernel does no special permission checking\n      other than verifying that the target envid is valid.\n   \n   Then implement\n      the ipc_recv and ipc_send functions\n      in lib/ipc.c.\n   \n   \n      Use the user/pingpong and user/primes\n      functions to test your IPC mechanism.  user/primes\n      will generate for each prime number a new environment until\n      JOS runs out of environments.  You might find it interesting\n      to read user/primes.c to see all the forking and IPC\n      going on behind the scenes.\n   \n\n   \n   Challenge!\n       The ipc_send function is not very fair.\n       Run three copies of user/fairness and you will\n       see this problem.  The first two copies are both trying to send to \n       the third copy, but only one of them will ever succeed.\n       Make the IPC fair, so that each copy has approximately\n       equal chance of succeeding.\n   \n\n   Challenge!\n      Why does ipc_send\n      have to loop?  Change the system call interface so it\n      doesn't have to.

Don't proceed until they work.  Don't forget to un-comment\nthese lines when you start Exercise 1.\n\n\n\nIf they don't work, use  git diff lab4 to review\nall the changes, making sure there isn't any code you wrote for lab4\n(or before) missing from lab 5.  Make sure that lab 4 still works.\n\nLab Requirements\n\nAs before, you will need\nto do all of the regular exercises described in the lab and at\nleast one challenge problem.\nAdditionally, you will\nneed to write up brief answers to the questions posed in the lab and a\nshort (e.g., one or two paragraph) description of what you did to\nsolve your chosen challenge problem.  If you implement more than one\nchallenge problem, you only need to describe one of them in the\nwrite-up, though of course you are welcome to do more.  Place the\nwrite-up in a file called answers-lab5.txt in the top level of\nyour lab5 directory before handing in your work.\n -->\n\nFile system preliminaries\n\n\nWe have provided you with a simple, read-only, disk-based file system. \nYou will need to slightly change your existing code in order to port\nthe file system for your JOS, so that\nspawn can access on-disk executables using path names.\n\nAlthough you do not have to understand every detail of the file system,\nsuch as its on-disk structure.  It is very important that you familiarize\nyourself with the design principles and its various interfaces.\n\n\n\nThe file system itself is implemented in micro-kernel fashion,\noutside the kernel but within its own user-space environment.\nOther environments access the file system by making IPC requests\nto this special file system environment.\n\n\n\nDisk Access\n\n\nThe file system environment in our operating system\nneeds to be able to access the disk,\nbut we have not yet implemented any disk access functionality in our kernel.\nInstead of taking the conventional \"monolithic\" operating system strategy\nof adding an IDE disk driver to the kernel\nalong with the necessary system calls to allow the file system to access it,\nwe instead implement the IDE disk driver\nas part of the user-level file system environment.\nWe will still need to modify the kernel slightly,\nin order to set things up so that the file system environment\nhas the privileges it needs to implement disk access itself.\n\n\nIt is easy to implement disk access in user space this way\nas long as we rely on polling, \"programmed I/O\" (PIO)-based disk access\nand do not use disk interrupts.\nIt is possible to implement interrupt-driven device drivers in user mode as well\n(the L3 and L4 kernels do this, for example),\nbut it is more difficult\nsince the kernel must field device interrupts\nand dispatch them to the correct user-mode environment.\n\n\nThe x86 processor uses the IOPL bits in the EFLAGS register\nto determine whether protected-mode code\nis allowed to perform special device I/O instructions\nsuch as the IN and OUT instructions.\nSince all of the IDE disk registers we need to access\nare located in the x86's I/O space rather than being memory-mapped,\ngiving \"I/O privilege\" to the file system environment\nis the only thing we need to do\nin order to allow the file system to access these registers.\nIn effect, the IOPL bits in the EFLAGS register\nprovides the kernel with a simple \"all-or-nothing\" method\nof controlling whether user-mode code can access I/O space.\nIn our case, we want the file system environment\nto be able to access I/O space,\nbut we do not want any other environments\nto be able to access I/O space at all.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.\ni386_init identifies the file system environment by\npassing the type ENV_TYPE_FS to your environment creation\nfunction, env_create.\nModify env_create in env.c,\nso that it gives the file system environment I/O privilege,\nbut never gives that privilege to any other environment.\n\nMake sure you can start the file environment without causing a General\nProtection fault.  You should pass the \"fs i/o\" test in make grade.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n \nDo you have to do anything else\nto ensure that this I/O privilege setting\nis saved and restored properly when you subsequently switch\nfrom one environment to another? Why?\n\n\n\n\nNote that the GNUmakefile file in this lab\nsets up QEMU to use the file obj/kern/kernel.img\nas the image for disk 0 (typically \"Drive C\" under DOS/Windows) as before,\nand to use the (new) file obj/fs/fs.img\nas the image for disk 1 (\"Drive D\").\nIn this lab our file system should only ever touch disk 1;\ndisk 0 is used only to boot the kernel.\nThe Block Cache\n\n\nIn our file system,\nwe will implement a simple \"buffer cache\" (really just a block cache)\nwith the help of the processor's virtual memory system.\nThe code for the block cache is in fs/bc.c.\n\n\n\nOur file system will be limited to handling disks of size 3GB or less.\nWe reserve a large, fixed 3GB region\nof the file system environment's address space,\nfrom 0x10000000 (DISKMAP)\nup to 0xD0000000 (DISKMAP+DISKMAX),\nas a \"memory mapped\" version of the disk.\nFor example,\ndisk block 0 is mapped at virtual address 0x10000000,\ndisk block 1 is mapped at virtual address 0x10001000,\nand so on.  The diskaddr function in fs/bc.c\nimplements this translation from disk block numbers to virtual\naddresses (along with some sanity checking).\n\n\n\nSince our file system environment has its own virtual address space\nindependent of the virtual address spaces\nof all other environments in the system,\nand the only thing the file system environment needs to do\nis to implement file access,\nit is reasonable to reserve most of the file system environment's address space\nin this way.\nIt would be awkward for a real file system implementation\non a 32-bit machine to do this\nsince modern disks are larger than 3GB.\nSuch a buffer cache management approach\nmay still be reasonable on a machine with a 64-bit address space.\n\n\n\nOf course, it would be unreasonable to read the entire disk into\nmemory, so instead we'll implement a form of demand paging,\nwherein we only allocate pages in the disk map region and read the\ncorresponding block from the disk in response to a page fault in this\nregion.  This way, we can pretend that the entire disk is in memory.\n\n\n\nExercise 2.\nImplement the bc_pgfault functions in fs/bc.c.\nbc_pgfault is a page fault handler, just like the one\nyour wrote in the previous lab for copy-on-write fork, except that\nits job is to load pages in from the disk in response to a page\nfault.  When writing this, keep in mind that (1) addr\nmay not be aligned to a block boundary and (2) ide_read\noperates in sectors, not blocks.\n\nUse make grade to test your code.  Your code should pass\n\"check_super\".\n\n\n\nThe fs_init function in fs/fs.c is a prime\nexample of how to use the block cache.  After initializing the block\ncache, it simply stores pointers into the disk map region in the\nsuper global variable.After this point, we can simply read from the super\nstructure as if they were in memory and our page fault handler will\n read them from disk as necessary.\nThe file system interface\n\n\n\nNow that we have the necessary functionality\nwithin the file system environment itself,\nwe must make it accessible to other environments\nthat wish to use the file system.\nSince other environments can't directly call functions in the file\nsystem environment, we'll expose access to the file system\nenvironment via a remote procedure call, or RPC, abstraction,\nbuilt atop JOS's IPC mechanism.\nGraphically, here's what a call to the file system server (say, read)\nlooks like\n\n\n\n      Regular env           FS env\n   +---------------+   +---------------+\n   |      read     |   |   file_read   |\n   |   (lib/fd.c)  |   |   (fs/fs.c)   |\n...|.......|.......|...|.......^.......|...............\n   |       v       |   |       |       | RPC mechanism\n   |  devfile_read |   |  serve_read   |\n   |  (lib/file.c) |   |  (fs/serv.c)  |\n   |       |       |   |       ^       |\n   |       v       |   |       |       |\n   |     fsipc     |   |     serve     |\n   |  (lib/file.c) |   |  (fs/serv.c)  |\n   |       |       |   |       ^       |\n   |       v       |   |       |       |\n   |   ipc_send    |   |   ipc_recv    |\n   |       |       |   |       ^       |\n   +-------|-------+   +-------|-------+\n           |                   |\n           +-------------------+\n\n\n\nEverything below the dotted line is simply the mechanics of getting a\nread request from the regular environment to the file system\nenvironment.  Starting at the beginning, read (which we\nprovide) works on any file descriptor and simply dispatches to the\nappropriate device read function, in this case\ndevfile_read (we can have more device types, like pipes).\n devfile_read\nimplements read specifically for on-disk files.  This and\nthe other devfile_* functions in lib/file.c\nimplement the client side of the FS operations and all work in roughly\nthe same way, bundling up arguments in a request structure, calling\nfsipc to send the IPC request, and unpacking and\nreturning the results.  The fsipc function simply handles\nthe common details of sending a request to the server and receiving\nthe reply.\n\n\n\nThe file system server code can be found in fs/serv.c.  It\nloops in the serve function, endlessly receiving a\nrequest over IPC, dispatching that request to the appropriate handler\nfunction, and sending the result back via IPC.  In the read example,\nserve will dispatch to serve_read, which\nwill take care of the IPC details specific to read requests such as\nunpacking the request structure and finally call\nfile_read to actually perform the file read.\n\n\n\nRecall that JOS's IPC mechanism lets an environment send a single\n32-bit number and, optionally, share a page.  To send a request from\nthe client to the server, we use the 32-bit number for the request\ntype (the file system server RPCs are numbered, just like how\nsyscalls were numbered) and store the arguments to the request in a\nunion Fsipc on the page shared via the IPC.  On the\nclient side, we always share the page at fsipcbuf; on the\nserver side, we map the incoming request page at fsreq\n(0x0ffff000).\n\n\n\nThe server also sends the response back via IPC.  We use the 32-bit\nnumber for the function's return code.  For most RPCs, this is all\nthey return.  FSREQ_READ and FSREQ_STAT also\nreturn data, which they simply write to the page that the client sent\nits request on.  There's no need to send this page in the response\nIPC, since the client shared it with the file system server in the\nfirst place.  Also, in its response, FSREQ_OPEN shares with\nthe client a new \"Fd page\". We'll return to the file descriptor \npage shortly.\n\n\nChallenge!\n    Extend the file system to support write access. \nHere are a few points you need to consider:\n\n    Use the block bitmap starting at block 2 to keep track of which\ndisk blocks are free and which are in use. \nLook at fs/fsformat.c to see how the bitmap is initialized.\n\n    Make use of the alloc argument in \nfile_block_walk. \nIn file_get_block, allocate new disk blocks as necessary.\n \n    In your block cache, use the VM hardware (the PTE_D\n \"dirty\" bit in the\n uvpt entry) to keep track of whether a cached disk block\n has been modified, and thus needs to be written back to the disk.\n \n    Handle O_CREAT and O_TRUNC open modes \nin serve_open.\n \n    Handle more file system IPC requests, such as \nFSREQ_SET_SIZE, FSREQ_WRITE, \nFSREQ_FLUSH, FSREQ_REMOVE\nand FSREQ_SYNC, in fs/serv.c. \nWe have defined the argument for these calls for you in inc/fs.h.\nAlso, write the corresponding service routines in fs/fs.c and\nhook them to client stubs in lib/file.c.\n\n    For more information about the file system's on-disk structure,\nread inc/fs.h and fs/fsformat.c. \nYou may also refer to \n\nlast year's lab 5 text.\n\n\n -->\n\n\nSpawning Processes\n\n\nWe have given you the code for spawn\nspawn, -->\nwhich creates a new environment,\nloads a program image from the file system into it,\nand then starts the child environment running this program.\nThe parent process then continues running independently of the child.\nThe spawn function effectively acts like a fork in UNIX\nfollowed by an immediate exec in the child process.\n\n\nWe implemented spawn rather than a\nUNIX-style exec because spawn is easier to\nimplement from user space in \"exokernel fashion\", without special help\nfrom the kernel.  Think about what you would have to do in order to\nimplement exec in user space, and be sure you understand\nwhy it is harder.\n\n\n\nExercise 3.\nspawn relies on the new syscall\nsys_env_set_trapframe to initialize the state of the\nnewly created environment.  Implement\nsys_env_set_trapframe.  Test your code by running the\nuser/spawnhello program\nfrom kern/init.c, which will attempt to\nspawn /hello from the file system.\n\nUse make grade to test your code.\n\n\n\nChallenge!\n    Implement Unix-style exec.\n\n\n\nChallenge!\n    Implement mmap-style memory-mapped files and\n    modify spawn to map pages directly from the ELF\n    image when possible.\n -->\nSharing library state across fork and spawn\n\n\nThe UNIX file descriptors are a general notion that also\nencompasses pipes, console I/O, etc.  In JOS, each of these device\ntypes has a corresponding struct Dev, \nwith pointers to the functions that implement\nread/write/etc. for that device type.  lib/fd.c implements the\ngeneral UNIX-like file descriptor interface on top of this.  Each\nstruct Fd indicates its device type, and most of the\nfunctions in lib/fd.c simply dispatch operations to functions\nin the appropriate struct Dev.\n\n\n\nlib/fd.c also maintains the file descriptor table\nregion in each application environment's address space, starting at\nFSTABLE.  This area reserves a page's worth (4KB) of\naddress space for each of the up to MAXFD (currently 32)\nfile descriptors the application can have open at once.  At any given\ntime, a particular file descriptor table page is mapped if and only if\nthe corresponding file descriptor is in use.  Each file descriptor\nalso has an optional \"data page\" in the region starting at\nFILEDATA, which devices can use if they choose.\n\n\n\n  We would like to share file descriptor state across\n  fork and spawn, but file descriptor state is kept\n  in user-space memory.  Right now, on fork, the memory\n  will be marked copy-on-write,\n  so the state will be duplicated rather than shared.\n  (This means environments won't be able to seek in files they\n  didn't open themselves and that pipes won't work across a fork.)\n  On spawn, the memory will be\n  left behind, not copied at all.  (Effectively, the spawned environment\n  starts with no open file descriptors.)\n\n\n\n  We will change fork to know that \n  certain regions of memory are used by the \"library operating system\" and\n  should always be shared.  Rather than hard-code a list of regions somewhere,\n  we will set an otherwise-unused bit in the page table entries (just like\n  we did with the PTE_COW bit in fork).\n\n\n\n  We have defined a new PTE_SHARE bit\n  in inc/lib.h.\n  This bit is one of the three PTE bits\n  that are marked \"available for software use\"\n  in the Intel and AMD manuals.\n  We will establish the convention that\n  if a page table entry has this bit set,\n  the PTE should be copied directly from parent to child\n  in both fork and spawn.\n  Note that this is different from marking it copy-on-write:\n  as described in the first paragraph,\n  we want to make sure to share\n  updates to the page.\n\n\n  \n    Exercise 4.\n\n  Change duppage in lib/fork.c to follow\n  the new convention.  If the page table entry has the PTE_SHARE\n  bit set, just copy the mapping directly.\n  (You should use PTE_SYSCALL, not 0xfff,\n  to mask out the relevant bits from the page table entry. 0xfff\n  picks up the accessed and dirty bits as well.)\n  \n\n  \n    Likewise, implement copy_shared_pages in\n    lib/spawn.c.  It should loop through all page table\n    entries in the current process (just like fork\n    did), copying any page mappings that have the\n    PTE_SHARE bit set into the child process.\n  \n\n\n  Use make run-testpteshare to check that your code is \n  behaving properly.\n  You should see lines that say \"fork handles PTE_SHARE right\"\n  and \"spawn handles PTE_SHARE right\".\n\n\n\n  Use make run-testfdsharing to check that file descriptors are shared\n  properly.\n  You should see lines that say \"read in child succeeded\" and\n  \"read in parent succeeded\".\n\n\nThe keyboard interface\n\n\n  For the shell to work, we need a way to type at it.\n  QEMU has been displaying output we write to\n  the CGA display and the serial port, but so far we've only taken\n  input while in the kernel monitor.\n  In QEMU, input typed in the graphical window appear as input\n  from the keyboard to JOS, while input typed to the console\n  appear as characters on the serial port.\n  kern/console.c already contains the keyboard and serial\n  drivers that have been used by the kernel monitor since lab 1,\n  but now you need to attach these to the rest\n  of the system.\n\n\n  \n    Exercise 5.\n  In your kern/trap.c, call kbd_intr to handle trap\n  IRQ_OFFSET+IRQ_KBD and serial_intr to\n  handle trap IRQ_OFFSET+IRQ_SERIAL.\n  \n\n\n  We implemented the console input/output file type for you,\n  in lib/console.c.\n\n\n\n  Test your code by running make run-testkbd and type\n  a few lines.  The system should echo your lines back to you as you finish them.\n  Try typing in both the console and the graphical window, if you\n  have both available.\n\n\nThe Shell\n\n\n  Run make run-icode or make run-icode-nox.\n  This will run your kernel and start user/icode.\n  icode execs init,\n  which will set up the console as file descriptors 0 and 1 (standard input and\n  standard output).  It will then spawn sh, the shell.\n  You should be able to run the following\n  commands:\n\n\n    echo hello world | cat\n    cat lorem |cat\n    cat lorem |num\n    cat lorem |num |num |num |num |num\n    lsfd\n    cat script\n    sh \n\n  Note that the user library routine cprintf\n  prints straight\n  to the console, without using the file descriptor code.  This is great\n  for debugging but not great for piping into other programs.\n  To print output to a particular file descriptor (for example, 1, standard output),\n  use fprintf(1, \"...\", ...).\n  printf(\"...\", ...) is a short-cut for printing to FD 1.\n  See user/lsfd.c for examples.\n\n\n\n  Run make run-testshell to test your shell.\n  testshell simply feeds the above commands (also found in\n  fs/testshell.sh) into the shell and then checks that the\n  output matches fs/testshell.key. \n\n\n\n  Your code should pass all tests at this point.  As usual, you can\n  grade your submission with make grade and hand it in with\n  make handin.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow long approximately did it take you to do this lab?\nWe simplified the file system this year with the goal of making \nmore time for the final project.

If\nthe makefile fails to detect your build tools,\nyou can specify their location  by adding the following line to\nconf/env.mk:\n\n\nGCCPREFIX=\n\n\n\nIf you are using something other than standard x86\nlinux or BSD, you will need the GNU C compiler toolchain, configured\nand built as a cross-compiler for the target\n'i386-jos-elf', as well as the GNU debugger, configured for \nthe i386-jos-elf toolchain.\nYou can download versions that are known\nto work with JOS\nvia the following links, although more recent versions of gcc and\nbinutils, and GDB should work too:\n\n\n\n    \n\n    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.19.tar.bz2\n\n    \n    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.1.2/gcc-core-4.1.2.tar.bz2\n\n    \n    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.2a.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've unpacked these archives, run the following commands as\nroot:\n\n\n# cd binutils-2.19\n# ./configure --target=i386-jos-elf --disable-nls\n# make\n# make install\n# cd ../gcc-4.1.2\n# ./configure --target=i386-jos-elf --disable-nls --without-headers \\\n              --with-newlib --disable-threads --disable-shared \\\n              --disable-libmudflap --disable-libssp\n# make\n# make install\n# cd ../gdb-7.2a\n# ./configure --target=i386-jos-elf --program-prefix=i386-jos-elf- \\\n              --disable-werror\n# make\n# make install\n\n\nIf there are errors compiling gcc when it gets to libstdc++, don't\nworry about it.\n-->\nThen you'll have in /usr/local/bin a bunch of binaries\nwith names like i386-jos-elf-gcc.  \nThe lab makefile\nshould detect this toolchain and use it in preference to your\nmachine's default toolchain.  If this doesn't work, there are\ninstructions on how to override the toolchain inside the GNUmakefile\nin the labs.\ni386-jos-elf-gcc instead of gcc.  There\nare instructions for how to do this inside of the Makefile.\n-->\n\nPatched GDB\n\nThe standard version of gdb does not correctly handle the transition \nto long mode during JOS boot, yielding a \"Packet too long\" error.\nThe patch below will fix this:\n\n\nGDB versions up to 7.3: patch\nGDB version 7.7.1 (and later): patch\n\n\nFor the provided environment, we have installed the patched gdb package for you.\nFor debugging 64-bit code on a 32-bit platform, you need both gdb and gdb-multiarch.\nBelow we post patched Ubuntu packages.\n\n\n\n amd64: \n     gdb 7.2.  \n     gdb 7.7.1 (Ubuntu 14.04). \n     gdb 7.11 (Ubuntu 16.04).  \n\ngdb-multiarch is not required on amd64.\n\n\n\nTo build gdb against another version on Ubuntu or Debian, e.g., for home use, follow these steps:\n\n    dpkg-source -x gdb-xxxxx.dsc   (the .dsc you installed)\n    cd gdb-xxx  (a newly created directory)\n    sudo apt-get build-dep gdb\n    download gdb-7.7.1-mute-message-too-long.patch\n    patch -p1 \n\n\nQEMU Emulator\nQEMU is a modern and fast\nPC emulator. \n\nUnfortunately, QEMU's debugging facilities, while powerful, are\nsomewhat immature, so we highly recommend you use the MIT patched version\nof QEMU instead of the stock version that may come with your\ndistribution.  The version installed on walter.cs.unc.edu is already patched.\nTo build your own patched version of QEMU:\n\n\n\n  Clone the MIT QEMU git repository\n  git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/6.828-qemu.git qemu\n  On Linux, you may need to install the SDL development libraries\n  to get a graphical VGA window.  On Debian/Ubuntu, this is the\n  libsdl1.2-dev package.\n  Configure the source code\n  Linux: ./configure --disable-kvm [--prefix=PFX] [--target-list=\"i386-softmmu x86_64-softmmu\"]\n  OS X: ./configure --disable-kvm --disable-sdl [--prefix=PFX] [--target-list=\"i386-softmmu x86_64-softmmu\"]\n  The prefix argument specifies where to install QEMU;\n  without it QEMU will install to /usr/local by default.  The\n  target-list argument simply slims down the\n  architectures QEMU will build support for.\n  \n  Run make && make install\n\n\nDebugging tips\n\nKernel\n\nGDB is your friend.  Use the qemu-gdb target (or its qemu-gdb-nox variant) to make\nQEMU wait for GDB to attach.  See the GDB reference\nbelow for some commands that are useful when debugging kernels.\n\nIf you're getting unexpected interrupts, exceptions, or triple\nfaults, you can ask QEMU to generate a detailed log of interrupts\nusing the -d argument.\n\nTo debug virtual memory issues, try the QEMU monitor commands info mem (for a high-level\noverview) or info pg (for lots\nof detail).  Note that these commands only display the current\npage table.\n\n(Lab 4+) To debug multiple CPUs, use GDB's thread-related commands\nlike thread and info threads.\n\nUser environments (lab 3+)\n\nGDB also lets you debug user environments, but there are a few\nthings you need to watch out for, since GDB doesn't know that there's\na distinction between multiple user environments, or between user and\nkernel.\n\nYou can start JOS with a specific user environment using make run-name (or you can edit\nkern/init.c directly).  To make QEMU wait for GDB to attach,\nuse the run-name-gdb\nvariant.\n\nYou can symbolically debug user code, just like you can kernel\ncode, but you have to tell GDB which symbol\ntable to use with the symbol-file command, since it\ncan only use one symbol table at a time.  The provided\n.gdbinit loads the kernel symbol table,\nobj/kern/kernel.  The symbol table for a user environment is\nin its ELF binary, so you can load it using symbol-file\nobj/user/name.  Don't load symbols from any\n.o files, as those haven't been relocated by the linker\n(libraries are statically linked into JOS user binaries, so those\nsymbols are already included in each user binary).  Make sure you get\nthe right user binary; library functions will be linked at\ndifferent EIPs in different binaries and GDB won't know any\nbetter!\n\n(Lab 4+) Since GDB is attached to the virtual machine as a whole,\nit sees clock interrupts as just another control transfer.  This makes\nit basically impossible to step through user code because a clock\ninterrupt is virtually guaranteed the moment you let the VM run again.\nThe stepi command works because it\nsuppresses interrupts, but it only steps one assembly instruction.  Breakpoints generally work, but watch out because\nyou can hit the same EIP in a different environment (indeed, a\ndifferent binary altogether!).\n\nReference\n\nJOS makefile\n\nThe JOS GNUmakefile includes a number of phony targets for running JOS\nin various ways.  All of these targets configure QEMU to listen for\nGDB connections (the *-gdb targets also wait for this\nconnection).  To start once QEMU is running, simply run gdb\nfrom your lab directory.  We provide a .gdbinit file that\nautomatically points GDB at QEMU, loads the kernel symbol file, and\nswitches between 16-bit and 32-bit mode.  Exiting GDB will shut down\nQEMU.\n\n  make qemu\n  Build everything and start QEMU with the VGA console in a new\n  window and the serial console in your terminal.  To exit, either\n  close the VGA window or press Ctrl-c or Ctrl-a x\n  in your terminal.\n\n  make qemu-nox\n  Like make qemu, but run with only the serial console.\n  To exit, press Ctrl-a x.  This is particularly useful over\n  SSH connections to Athena dialups because the VGA window consumes a\n  lot of bandwidth.\n\n  make qemu-gdb\n  Like make qemu, but rather than passively accepting GDB\n  connections at any time, this pauses at the first machine\n  instruction and waits for a GDB connection.\n\n  make qemu-nox-gdb\n  A combination of the qemu-nox and qemu-gdb\n  targets.\n\n  make run-name\n  (Lab 3+) Run user program name.  For example, make\n  run-hello runs user/hello.c.\n\n  make run-name-nox,\n      run-name-gdb,\n      run-name-gdb-nox, \n  (Lab 3+) Variants of run-name that correspond to\n  the variants of the qemu target.\n\n\nThe makefile also accepts a few useful variables:\n\n  make V=1 ...\n  Verbose mode.  Print out every command being executed, including\n  arguments.\n\n  make V=1 grade\n  Stop after any failed grade test and leave the QEMU output in\n  jos.out for inspection.\n\n  make QEMUEXTRA='args' ...\n  Specify additional arguments to pass to QEMU.\n\n\nJOS obj/\n\nWhen building JOS, the makefile also produces some additional\noutput files that may prove useful while debugging:\n\n\n  obj/boot/boot.asm,\n  obj/kern/kernel.asm, obj/user/hello.asm, etc.\n  Assembly code listings for the bootloader, kernel, and user\n  programs.\n\n  obj/kern/kernel.sym,\n  obj/user/hello.sym, etc.\n  Symbol tables for the kernel and user programs.\n\n  obj/boot/boot.out, obj/kern/kernel,\n  obj/user/hello, etc\n  Linked ELF images of the kernel and user programs.  These\n  contain symbol information that can be used by GDB.\n\n\nGDB\n\nSee the GDB\nmanual for a full guide to GDB commands.  Here are some\nparticularly useful commands for 6.828, some of which don't typically\ncome up outside of OS development.\n\n\n  Ctrl-c\n  Halt the machine and break in to GDB at the current\n  instruction.  If QEMU has multiple virtual CPUs, this halts all of\n  them.\n\n  c (or continue)\n  Continue execution until the next breakpoint or Ctrl-c.\n\n  si (or stepi)\n  Execute one machine instruction.\n\n  b function or b file:line (or\n  breakpoint)\n  Set a breakpoint at the given function or line.\n\n  b *addr (or breakpoint)\n  Set a breakpoint at the EIP addr.\n\n  set print pretty\n  Enable pretty-printing of arrays and structs.\n\n  info registers\n  Print the general purpose registers, eip,\n  eflags, and the segment selectors.  For a much more\n  thorough dump of the machine register state, see QEMU's own info\n  registers command.\n\n  x/Nx addr\n  Display a hex dump of N words starting at virtual address\n  addr.  If N is omitted, it defaults to 1.  addr\n  can be any expression.\n\n  x/Ni addr\n  Display the N assembly instructions starting at\n  addr.  Using $eip as addr will display the\n  instructions at the current instruction pointer.\n\n  symbol-file file\n  (Lab 3+) Switch to symbol file file.  When GDB attaches\n  to QEMU, it has no notion of the process boundaries within the\n  virtual machine, so we have to tell it which symbols to use.  By\n  default, we configure GDB to use the kernel symbol file,\n  obj/kern/kernel.  If the machine is running user code, say\n  hello.c, you can switch to the hello symbol file using\n  symbol-file obj/user/hello.\n\n\nQEMU represents each virtual CPU as a thread in GDB, so you can use\nall of GDB's thread-related commands to view or manipulate QEMU's\nvirtual CPUs.\n\n\n  thread n\n  GDB focuses on one thread (i.e., CPU) at a time.  This command\n  switches that focus to thread n, numbered from zero.\n\n  info threads\n  List all threads (i.e., CPUs), including their state (active or\n  halted) and what function they're in.\n\n\nQEMU\n\nQEMU includes a built-in monitor that can inspect and modify the\nmachine state in useful ways.  To enter the monitor, press Ctrl-a\nc in the terminal running QEMU.  Press Ctrl-a c again\nto switch back to the serial console.\n\nFor a complete reference to the monitor commands, see the QEMU\nmanual.  Here are some particularly useful commands:\n\n\n  xp/Nx paddr\n  Display a hex dump of N words starting at physical\n  address paddr.  If N is omitted, it defaults to 1.\n  This is the physical memory analogue of GDB's x\n  command.\n\n  info registers\n  Display a full dump of the machine's internal register state.\n  In particular, this includes the machine's hidden segment\n  state for the segment selectors and the local, global, and interrupt\n  descriptor tables, plus the task register.  This hidden state is the\n  information the virtual CPU read from the GDT/LDT when the segment\n  selector was loaded.  Here's the CS when running in the JOS kernel\n  in lab 1 and the meaning of each field:\n\n  CS =0008 10000000 ffffffff 10cf9a00 DPL=0 CS32 [-R-]\n  \n    CS =0008\n    The visible part of the code selector.  We're using segment\n    0x8.  This also tells us we're referring to the global descriptor\n    table (0x8&4=0), and our CPL (current privilege level) is\n    0x8&3=0.\n    10000000\n    The base of this segment.  Linear address = logical address +\n    0x10000000.\n    ffffffff\n    The limit of this segment.  Linear addresses above 0xffffffff\n    will result in segment violation exceptions.\n    10cf9a00\n    The raw flags of this segment, which QEMU helpfully decodes\n    for us in the next few fields.\n    DPL=0\n    The privilege level of this segment.  Only code running with\n    privilege level 0 can load this segment.\n    CS32\n    This is a 32-bit code segment.  Other values include\n    DS for data segments (not to be confused with the DS\n    register), and LDT for local descriptor tables.\n    [-R-]\n    This segment is read-only.\n  \n  \n\n  info mem\n  (Lab 2+) Display mapped virtual memory and permissions.  For\n  example,\n\n  ef7c0000-ef800000 00040000 urw\nefbf8000-efc00000 00008000 -rw\n\n  tells us that the 0x00040000 bytes of memory from 0xef7c0000 to\n  0xef800000 are mapped read/write and user-accessible, while the\n  memory from 0xefbf8000 to 0xefc00000 is mapped read/write, but only\n  kernel-accessible.\n  \n\n  info pg\n  (Lab 2+) Display the current page table structure.  The output\n  is similar to info mem, but distinguishes page directory\n  entries and page table entries and gives the permissions for each\n  separately.  Repeated PTE's and entire page tables are folded up\n  into a single line.  For example,\n\n  VPN range     Entry         Flags        Physical page\n[00000-003ff]  PDE[000]     -------UWP\n  [00200-00233]  PTE[200-233] -------U-P 00380 0037e 0037d 0037c 0037b 0037a ..\n[00800-00bff]  PDE[002]     ----A--UWP\n  [00800-00801]  PTE[000-001] ----A--U-P 0034b 00349\n  [00802-00802]  PTE[002]     -------U-P 00348\n\n\n  This shows two page directory entries, spanning virtual addresses\n  0x00000000 to 0x003fffff and 0x00800000 to 0x00bfffff, respectively.\n  Both PDE's are present, writable, and user and the second PDE is also\n  accessed.  The second of these page tables maps three pages, spanning\n  virtual addresses 0x00800000 through 0x00802fff, of which the first\n  two are present, user, and accessed and the third is only present and\n  user.  The first of these PTE's maps physical page 0x34b.\n  \n\n\nQEMU also takes some useful command line arguments, which can be\npassed into the JOS makefile using the \n\nQEMUEXTRA variable.\n\n\n  make QEMUEXTRA='-d int' ...\n  Log all interrupts, along with a full register dump, to\n  qemu.log.  You can ignore the first two log entries, \"SMM:\n  enter\" and \"SMM: after RMS\", as these are generated before entering\n  the boot loader.  After this, log entries look like\n       4: v=30 e=0000 i=1 cpl=3 IP=001b:00800e2e pc=00800e2e SP=0023:eebfdf28 EAX=00000005\nEAX=00000005 EBX=00001002 ECX=00200000 EDX=00000000\nESI=00000805 EDI=00200000 EBP=eebfdf60 ESP=eebfdf28\n...\n  The first line describes the interrupt.  The 4: is just a\n  log record counter.  v gives the vector number in hex.\n  e gives the error code.  i=1 indicates that this\n  was produced by an int instruction (versus a hardware\n  interrupt).  The rest of the line should be self-explanatory.  See\n  info registers for a description\n  of the register dump that follows.\n  \n  Note: If you're running a pre-0.15 version of QEMU, the log will\n  be written to /tmp instead of the current directory.\n\n"},"REFERENCE.html":{"url":"REFERENCE.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"OS textbooks\nUNIX\n\n       Youtube Unix intro\n       \n      The UNIX Time-Sharing System,\n      Dennis\n      M.
